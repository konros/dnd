<blockquote>
<p>“Why do I live here? Why live in the most regimented, law-abiding,  oppressive city this side of Bloodsworn Vale? Answer’s simple, mate. With the Sable Company flapping around in the clouds, Hellknights stomping around on the streets, and the Korvosan Guard caught between them, no one knows who’s got jurisdiction over what. You just gotta know when to hide and know when to bribe. Now, you wanna buy this magic dagger or not?”<br>

<h2 id="campaign-summary">Campaign Summary</h2>
<p>Campaign 2 will be a fairly urban campaign set in the city of Korvosa. Think more Kings Landing than Rivendale. The city is heavily adapted from the original Pathfinder adventure path it is based on (If you are already familiar with this city/adventure path please let me know in advance). Due to the nature of the setting, Campaign 2 will have more roleplaying and combat than pure dungeon delving.</p>
<p>In preparation for our Session 0, I have listed below what I need from you during character creation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Alignment</li>
<li>Ideals</li>
<li>Bonds</li>
<li>Flaws</li>
<li>Background</li>
</ul>
<p>All Races available in the rules for character options are allowed for play, including uncommon races (per DM discretion). The exceptions for this rule are Dragonborn and Drow</p>
<p>All classes and character options within each class are allowed for play.</p>
<p><strong>Allowed Alignments:</strong> While I recognize that most players are able to portray characters that run a wide range of motivations, there is a need to curtail self-destructive and criminal behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Deities</strong> This campaign takes place in the Golarion campaign setting and therefore the Golarion gods are available. Work with me to determine which domains are suitable for which deity.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bqtoAzp.png" alt="Deities of Golarion"></p>
<p>Most importantly, I need to know <em>why</em> your character cares about Korvosa. This is needed for the story to continue. As you can imagine a character that does not care about the setting of his story would soon lose their agency.</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-summary-of-korvosa">A Brief Summary of Korvosa</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HRuXhn2.png" alt="The City of Korvosa"></p>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>Conflict, misery, and division define the history of Korvosa. Founded as an island fortress at the edge of a hostile and untamed land, Korvosa evolved over time into a bustling and energetic trade center.</p>
<p>In <strong>4407 ar</strong>, Field Marshal Jakthion Korvosa rescued an abandoned group of Chelish marines trapped on a hostile island and founded Fort Korvosa. The settlement acted as a strong defensive position and trading post for settlers, pioneers, trappers, and explorers in the area. After much of the settlement burned down during a raid by the natives to the area, an event known as the <em>The Great Fire</em>, an influx of Chelish gold and tradesmen strengthened the settlement’s defenses and allowed its residents to move onto the mainland.</p>
<p>An ill-fated insult against a very prominent Korvosan noble family sparked the <em>Cousins’ War,</em> in <strong>4502 ar</strong>. The war ended Korvosa’s role as a military outpost and—with a further inf lux of Chelish nobility—made the settlement into a true colony. A period of great wealth followed, leading to a steady increase in size.</p>
<p>Korvosa’s prosperity came crashing down in <strong>4606 ar</strong>, when the unexpected death of Aroden kicked off a civil war in Imperial Cheliax. Cut off from its homeland without a word, Korvosa survived these dark times. Today about 200 years later the city prospers again, thanks to its self appointed royalty.</p>
<h3 id="culture-and-people">Culture and People</h3>
<p>The command King Erodred II exerts over the city is constantly checked by the arbiters, magistrates, and nobles, the city’s most politically powerful groups. More than judges, the arbiters not only determine the guilt or innocence of defendants in a court of law, but also have legislative oversight. No one exactly knows what the 23 magistrates or their staffs do, but most Korvosans suspect the entire purpose of city hall is to waste the time and money of the city’s people. Finally, two overlapping divisions define Korvosa’s aristocracy: the five most powerful families bear the coveted title of Great Houses, giving their members special privileges within the city, and 21 noble houses make up the Dock Families, allowing them to charge berthing fees on one or more docks in the city.</p>
<h3 id="races">Races</h3>
<p>Every civilized humanoid race in Golarion has at least one representative somewhere in Korvosa, usually within Midland District. Make no mistake, though: despite its cosmopolitan leanings, Korvosa is definitely a human city.</p>
<p>Look at any cross-section of the city’s population and you will find that for every 10 inhabitants you see, 9 are human. This homogeny exists even among the humans of the city, as an equally large percentage of the population descends, at least partially, from Cheliax <em>(caucasia)</em>.</p>
<h2 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h2>
<h3 id="the-tie-that-binds">The Tie That Binds</h3>
<p>Korvosa, like any city, has its share of undesirables. Cutpurses, thugs, thieves, burglars, assassins, and lowlifes of every sort can be found in waterfront slums, creeping in the sewers, or hiding in the tangled Shingles above. The Korvosan Guard does what it can to keep the city’s criminals from causing too much harm, but the cold reality is that they will always outnumber the law. And that means some crimes go unpunished and some criminals see great success.</p>
<p>Worst of these, perhaps, are the city’s crimelords. Dozens of them operate in Korvosa at any one time, from the sinister leader of the Red Mantis assassins all the way down to the Varisian Sczarni thugs who preside over a gang of a half-dozen friends and cousins. These minor crimelords are often, ironically, the ones who do the most damage to Korvosa’s law-abiding citizens, as larger organizations have little need to bother commoners. One such undesirable is Gaedren Lamm, a despicable low-life who missed his chance at being somebody big in Korvosa’s murky underworld. Well past his prime, the decrepit thief abducts orphans and forces them to support his despicable lifestyle with petty crime. Many of Korvosa’s lower class have had dealings with Lamm, and even a few of the city’s middle class and nobility have had their lives complicated by this foul old man. Yet no matter what he does, he always seems to slip away from the guards and avoid answering for his crimes.</p>
<p>Even before this campaign begins, you and the other PCs have a shared trait—you’ve all been wronged, in some manner, by the despicable Gaedren Lamm.</p>
<h3 id="character-backstory">Character Backstory</h3>
<p>Since this is a story driven campaign, it is often a great benefit that your character has a great and rewarding backstory as well. You do not have to share these answers with your fellow players. However, please do share the answers with the DM so I can more tie your character into the plot and storyline during the campaign.</p>
<p>Write a basic background for the character. If you’re having trouble - make a checklist first. What was their childhood like? Adolescence? How wealthy were their parents (or guardians), and how were they treated? How long ago did they become an adult (if they have)? What have they done to try and start a career as an adult (if anything)? Your character, no matter what you decide to do, is not gainfully employed (read: don’t write in TOO cushy of a job, or else - why would they leave? As per the players guide only Merchant background starts with a small business.) at the moment, and you need to think about why. Are they a Guardsman that hasn’t been initiated yet? Are they a cutpurse? Are they a child of a well-to-do family that has kicked them out of the nest? Make sure you cover the key points from your background selection from the PHB</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe at least two people that are tied to the character. One of them should be friendly to your character - a friend, a parent, a benefactor, etc. One of them should be hostile to your character - a rival, someone you owe money to, a Guardsman that has to keep taking you in for pickpocketing.</li>
<li>How does your character interact with the others within a group?</li>
<li>What is your character’s role in a group?</li>
<li>What are your character’s goals, conscious and, perhaps, subconscious?</li>
<li>How easily does your character love?Have they been in love?</li>
<li>Is your character racist at all, either now or in their past?</li>
<li>All people believe something that is not true, both about the world around them and about themselves. What lies/untruths does your character believe about themselves and the world around them?</li>
<li>How is your character about material possessions?</li>
<li>What does your character perceive their major problems to be?</li>
<li>What does your character perceive the solutions to those problems to be?</li>
<li>What are your character’s religious beliefs?</li>
<li>What does your character fear? It doesn’t need to be an object. Find something for your character that is a source of either shame or extremely hurt pride. Something that if it came out, your character just knows they’d be ruined, one way or another. Your thief is working for two different bosses. You owe a more than handsome sum to a bookie. You have a bastard child.</li>
<li>How much of a temper does your character have? What sorts of things set them off?</li>
<li>Where is his/her family? Do they have any siblings? Close friends? Who is important to them?</li>
<li>Describe a mannerism or quirk that your character has. If they’re a gambler, do they always have dice they carry? Do they have some kind of unfortunate verbal tic or speech impediment (shut up… I know I do asshole… don’t say it.)? Do they dress above or below their station? Is it obvious?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="homebrew">Homebrew</h2>
<h3 id="core-rule-changes">Core Rule Changes</h3>
<p><strong>Knowledge (Korvosa):</strong> Knowledge (Korvosa) is an intelligence based check. Unless you are from outside the city, your character is considered proficient with it. (Folk Hero, Hermit, and Outlander may or may not have it based on the case at hand.)</p>
<p><strong>New Languages:</strong> <strong>Varisian</strong> and <strong>Shoanti</strong> are the languages of the two native  ethnic groups of Varisia. Varisian is the language of the nomadic, artists. Shoanti is the language of the tribe’s barbaric people of the inland regions of Varisia.</p>
<p><strong>Short Rest Changes:</strong>  A character can’t spend any Hit Dice after finishing a short rest until someone expends one use of a healer’s kit to bandage and treat a character’s wounds. A character who finishes a long rest still regains full HP as normal.</p>
<p><strong>Healer’s Kits:</strong> Healer’s Kits automatically stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points if the user is proficient in Wisdom(Medicine). Users not proficient get advantage on the Wisdom(Medicine) roll to stabilize a creature instead.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="death-and-dying">Death and Dying</h3>
<p>If your character dies for some unfortunate reason or if you just got sliced up by a goblin during the campaign then the following takes rules apply</p>
<h4 id="resurection-challenge">Resurection Challenge</h4>
<p>If a character is dead and a return from death is attempted by a spell or spell effect with longer than a one action casting time, a Resurrection Challenge is initiated. Up to 3 members of the adventuring party can offer to contribute to the ritual via skill checks. For example praying to the god of the devout, fallen character may require a Religion check. Where as, loudly demanding the soul of the fallen to return from the aether may require a Charisma check (at the appropriate DC). Advantage or Disadvantage can apply here based on how perfect or off base the contribution offered is.</p>
<p>For each successful contribution skill check the DC of the final resurrection check is decreased. Upon a successful resurrection check, the player’s soul (should it be willing) will be returned to the body and the ritual succeeded. On a failed check, the soul does not return and the character is lost.</p>
<h4 id="raised-or-create-a-new-character">Raised or Create a New Character</h4>
<p>If you die and cannot be raised then you must create a new character. The DM will work with you on specifics of your new character’s introduction to the group. What transpired prior to their arrival, etc.</p>
<p>If you must create a new character, then that character starts one level lower than what the average party level is currently at unless the party is still at first level in which case you will start at the same level. You will stay one level behind until the next time a leveling milestone is crossed, at the time you will be brought back up to the current level of the party.</p>

Whenever you cast a prepared arcane spell from the conjuration school that takes 1 minute to cast, you can elect to reduce the casting time to a standard action instead.

For example, if you drew a card from the suit of Wisdom, you may gain advantage on ONE Wisdom save or a Wisdom-based skill check. If you drew a card from the suit of Dexterity, you could gain advantage on ONE Initiative check or a Dexterity save. You may decide to use this ONE-time advantage roll after you make the initial roll, but you must do so before you know if the roll was a success or not.</p>

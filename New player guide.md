<p>“Why do I live here? Why live in the most regimented, law-abiding,<br>
oppressive city this side of Bloodsworn Vale? Answer’s simple, mate.<br>
With the Sable Company flapping around in the clouds, Hellknights<br>
stomping around on the streets, and the Korvosan Guard caught between<br>
them, no one knows who’s got jurisdiction over what. You just gotta<br>
know when to hide and know when to bribe. Now, you wanna buy this<br>
magic dagger or not?”<br>

<h2 id="campaign-summary">Campaign Summary</h2>
<p>Campaign 2 will be a fairly urban campaign set in the city of Korvosa. Think more Kings Landing than Rivendale. The city is heavily adapted from the original Pathfinder adventure path it is based on (If you are already familiar with this city/adventure path please let me know in advance). Due to the nature of the setting, Campaign 2 will have more roleplaying and combat than pure dungeon delving.</p>
<p>In preparation for our Session 0, I have listed below what I need from you during character creation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Alignment</li>
<li>Ideals</li>
<li>Bonds</li>
<li>Flaws</li>
<li>Background</li>
</ul>
<p>All Races available in the rules for character options are allowed for play, including uncommon races (per DM discretion). The exceptions for this rule are Dragonborn and Drow</p>
<p>All classes and character options within each class are allowed for play.</p>
<p><strong>Allowed Alignments:</strong> While I recognize that most players are able to portray characters that run a wide range of motivations, there is a need to curtail self-destructive and criminal behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Deities</strong> This campaign takes place in the Golarion campaign setting and therefore the Golarion gods are available. Work with me to determine which domains are suitable for which deity.</p>

<p>Most importantly, I need to know <em>why</em> your character cares about Korvosa. This is needed for the story to continue. As you can imagine a character that does not care about the setting of his story would soon lose their agency.</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-summary-of-korvosa">A Brief Summary of Korvosa</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HRuXhn2.png" alt="The City of Korvosa"></p>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>Conflict, misery, and division define the history of Korvosa. Founded as an island fortress at the edge of a hostile and untamed land, Korvosa evolved over time into a bustling and energetic trade center.</p>
<p>In <strong>4407 ar</strong>, Field Marshal Jakthion Korvosa rescued an abandoned group of Chelish marines trapped on a hostile island and founded Fort Korvosa. The settlement acted as a strong defensive position and trading post for settlers, pioneers, trappers, and explorers in the area. After much of the settlement burned down during a raid by the natives to the area, an event known as the <em>The Great Fire</em>, an influx of Chelish gold and tradesmen strengthened the settlement’s defenses and allowed its residents to move onto the mainland.</p>
<p>An ill-fated insult against a very prominent Korvosan noble family sparked the <em>Cousins’ War,</em> in <strong>4502 ar</strong>. The war ended Korvosa’s role as a military outpost and—with a further inf lux of Chelish nobility—made the settlement into a true colony. A period of great wealth followed, leading to a steady increase in size.</p>
<p>Korvosa’s prosperity came crashing down in <strong>4606 ar</strong>, when the unexpected death of Aroden kicked off a civil war in Imperial Cheliax. Cut off from its homeland without a word, Korvosa survived these dark times. Today about 200 years later the city prospers again, thanks to its self appointed royalty.</p>
<h3 id="culture-and-people">Culture and People</h3>
<p>The command King Erodred II exerts over the city is constantly checked by the arbiters, magistrates, and nobles, the city’s most politically powerful groups. More than judges, the arbiters not only determine the guilt or innocence of defendants in a court of law, but also have legislative oversight. No one exactly knows what the 23 magistrates or their staffs do, but most Korvosans suspect the entire purpose of city hall is to waste the time and money of the city’s people. Finally, two overlapping divisions define Korvosa’s aristocracy: the five most powerful families bear the coveted title of Great Houses, giving their members special privileges within the city, and 21 noble houses make up the Dock Families, allowing them to charge berthing fees on one or more docks in the city.</p>
<h3 id="races">Races</h3>
<p>Every civilized humanoid race in Golarion has at least one representative somewhere in Korvosa, usually within Midland District. Make no mistake, though: despite its cosmopolitan leanings, Korvosa is definitely a human city.</p>
<p>Look at any cross-section of the city’s population and you will find that for every 10 inhabitants you see, 9 are human. This homogeny exists even among the humans of the city, as an equally large percentage of the population descends, at least partially, from Cheliax <em>(caucasia)</em>.</p>

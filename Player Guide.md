<h1 id="zeitgeist---campaign-3---new-player-guide">Zeitgeist - Campaign 3 - New Player Guide</h1>
<p>Steam and soot darken the skies above the city of Flint, and winds sweeping across its majestic harbor blow the choking products of industrial forges into the fey-rainforests that dot its knife-toothed mountains. Since the earliest ages when the people of Risur founded this city, they feared the capricious beings that hid in those fog-shrouded peaks, but now, as the march of progress and the demands of national defense turn Flint into a garden for artifice and technology, the old faiths and rituals that kept the lurkers of the woods at bay are being abandoned.</p>
<p>The Unseen Court, the Great Hunt, and the many spirits of the land long ago conquered by Risur’s kings no longer receive tribute, but they cannot enter these new cities of steam and steel to demand their tithe. The impoverished workers who huddle in factory slums fear monsters of a different breed, shadowy children of this new urban labyrinth. Even their modern religions have no defenses against these fiends.</p>
<p>Times are turning. The skyseers — Risur’s folk prophets since their homeland’s birth — witness omens in the starry wheels of heaven, and they warn that a new age is nigh. But what they cannot foresee, hidden beyond the steam and soot of the night sky, is the face of this coming error the spirit of the next age. The <em>Zeitgeist</em>.</p>
<h2 id="primer">Primer</h2>
<p>A step away from classic fantasy… Your characters serve in the Royal Homeland Constabulary of the nation of Risur, protecting the country and its citizens from foreign threats lurking within its borders. During missions of investigation, espionage, and assassination, your duty will be to root out hostile spies and pursue international conspiracies.</p>

<h3 id="humans-and-the-great-nations">Humans and the Great Nations</h3>
<p>Humans rule three of the five great nations of the continent Lanjyr. Their ascendancy in the past two thousand years toppled a mighty eladrin empire and has provoked belief in doomsday prophecy and fatalism among many dwarves. The campaign begins in Risur, and every PC should have a strong loyalty to the nation, even if the character does not hail from there. While Risur is predominately human, halflings are not unknown, and the nation’s traditional druidic religion makes it a welcome home of elves and gnomes.</p>
<h3 id="eladrin-devas-and-the-great-malice.">Eladrin, Devas, and the Great Malice.</h3>
<p>Long ago a civilization of elves known as the eladrin built an empire of magical wonders. Then five hundred years ago the death of the eladrin goddess Srasama caused nearly every eladrin woman to perish. Those few who survived were often claimed as trophies by human conquerors, though a handful of free matriarchs head their own family lines in the ruins of the old empire.</p>
<p>Mortals present at the death of the eladrin goddess have continually reincarnated in the following centuries as devas, as if a sliver of Srasama’s divine spark has granted them a semblance of immortality. Those interested in devas should read the section on Crisillyir.</p>
<h3 id="tieflings-and-dead-magic">Tieflings and Dead Magic</h3>
<p>When the eladrin goddess died, Danor became a dead magic zone, and some in that land were marked by a curse, turning them into tieflings. In the centuries since, however, the tieflings have come to rule that nation, and in the last few decades they have begun a revolution of industry and mighty science almost as powerful as the magic they lack.</p>
<h3 id="dwarves-doomsday-and-nihilism">Dwarves, Doomsday, and Nihilism</h3>
<p>The major dwarven nation is bleakly resigned to an imminent doomsday, when ancient horrors will claw free from glaciers and engulf the world in a frigid death. Adherence to duty is so ingrained in their culture, however, that the dwarves continue to toil in their forges even as they prepare for the world’s end.</p>
<h3 id="savages-primitives-and-peace">Savages, Primitives, and Peace</h3>
<p>Freed from the yoke of toppled dragon tyrants, the youngest of the great nations formed from an alliance of several monstrous races which now live in an uneasy peace as their rulers seek to force the disparate peoples into the modern age.</p>
<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>
<p>While the city of Flint sits under a haze of coal soot, its streets illuminated at night by gaslight lanterns and its ferries powered by steam boilers, the majority of Risur remains at roughly a Renaissance level of technology. Soldiers carry alchemical pistols as back-up weapons, and elite fusilier units carry muskets and carbines, but aside from the occasional new rail line splitting the countryside, most citizens of Risur never see any of the new technology that is changing the world around them.</p>
<p>To be clear, though, there are no automobiles, electric lights, or flying vehicles. Most firearms still are muzzle-loaders, and rifles and revolvers only exist as custom creations of innovative gunsmiths.</p>
<h3 id="piety-and-the-planes">Piety and the Planes</h3>
<p>The heavens possess an undeniable hold on the world’s religions, its people, and its very structure. In Risur, skyseers believe that the movements of the night stars foretell the future and direct the fate of the world. More enlightened scholars study distant planes of elemental and temporal power to understand how the flow of their energies affects the fundamental nature of reality. The eladrin people have begun to withdraw into the Dreaming (a shining reflection of this world, inhabited by fey), and to frighten sinners the bishops of the high church of the Clergy invoke condemned spirits from the Bleak Gate (a dark mirror of the real world, where dead linger before they find their eternal reward).</p>
<p>Other planes exist only as postulations, and there are countless theories on the nature of reality. No one in this world has ever traveled to the Astral Plane or Nine Hells, and even travel between the known worlds of the night sky is brief, with summoned beings never remaining more than a few minutes.</p>
<h2 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h2>
<p>I assume as a baseline that your characters in the adventure will work for the Royal Homeland Constabulary, a Risuri organization created by King Aodhan to monitor threats to his nation, both domestic and from foreign lands.</p>
<p>Every constable must have passed a background check and magical inquisition to prove his or her loyalty to Risur. These precautions allow even foreign-born citizens to serve, giving the constabulary a valuable tool in pursuing investigations overseas. Groups of constables are often assigned to pool their talents to accomplish dangerous and complex tasks, such as rescue missions,<br>
surveillance to catch smugglers and traitors, and even espionage or assassination.</p>
<p>Every PC should have a strong devotion to Risur, though PCs can certainly have other affiliations and allegiances that may eventually draw them away. Additionally, over the course of the campaign the PCs will encounter other power groups with their own motivations. One of the themes of the campaign is deciding what one believes in and why, so feel free to nudge your fellow PCs toward one faction or another as the campaign progresses. Remember, though, that games can quickly turn unfun without party unity.</p>
<p>Your character starts the adventure at 3rd level.</p>
<h3 id="salary">Salary</h3>
<p>As constables of Risur, your characters have a slightly different relationship with treasure than typical Fifth Edition adventurers.</p>
<p>Firstly, you’re assumed to receive a reasonable salary that covers “comfortable” living expenses, but needs not be tracked in-game.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Constabulary’s resources and connections let you requisition the tools you need for your missions. Particularly respectable constables can even make use of magic items from the royal vaults.</p>
<h4 id="upgrades-loot-and-skimming-off-the-top">Upgrades, Loot, and Skimming Off the Top</h4>
<p>When you recover magic items, treasure, or other valuables, RHC protocols allow you to make use of them for a limited period of time, if you need them. However once they are no longer required, you are expected to hand them over to higher authorities, who will make proper use of them. If desired, you can place a requisition to keep these items long-term, assuming you file the proper paperwork and your request is deemed warranted. (See Requisitions in Part Two.)</p>
<p>An alternative, of course, is to hold onto items and not report them to the RHC. This is illegal, and would likely be grounds for dismissal. Such pecuniary misdeeds are expected of common police, but the RHC is held to higher standards. Be careful, because prison is not kind to former law officers who turn to crime.</p>
<p>If you should happen to receive a gift during the course of your duties, you can keep it, though the RHC keeps an eye on constables to ensure they are not being influenced by bribes.</p>
<h3 id="classes">Classes</h3>
<p>Every class has a place in the world, though the RHC is unlikely to admit a savage barbarian who hasn’t at least learned Risuri manners. Due to its druidic traditions, clerics from Risur tend to have the Nature domain, paladins favor the Oath of the Ancients, and warlocks favor Archfey patrons. However, as long as a person is loyal to Risur, they can be a constable regardless of nation of origin.</p>
<h3 id="religion">Religion</h3>
<p>Gods do not make themselves regularly known in this world, and it is impossible to visit the planes where they reside, so it’s even possible to doubt whether they exist at all. Indeed, some strong-willed people have drawn divine power from the shared will of others who share their same philosophy. A few deities played a prominent role in history — like the dead eladrin goddess Srasama and the fishermanturned- god Triegenes — but otherwise you are free to decide which gods your characters worship, if any.</p>
<h3 id="magic">Magic</h3>
<p>Only two types of magic are wholly off-limits: long-duration flight, and long-duration planar travel.</p>
<p>The nature of the elemental planes that feed energy into the world makes it impossible for magic to create permanent flight. Powers that grant flight for never last more than five minutes, though flight with wings is fine, as long as the creature is Medium sized or smaller. There are no flying carpets or airships. Since the reported extinction of dragons, flying creatures do not grow any larger than an eagle or condor. Likewise, despite theories that suggest it should be possible to travel to distant planets via mighty rituals, all attempts to visit any foreign world never last longer than a few rounds before the traveler is shunted back to this plane. It is possible to wander into the Dreaming or the Bleak Gate and return, but even these trips are usually only possible when the moon and stars align properly, and getting back can be even more difficult than going in the first place.</p>
<p>Mechanically, this means that no creature can ever leave its home plane for more than five minutes, barring unique circumstances that are beyond the control of player characters.</p>
<h4 id="gold-and-teleportation">Gold and Teleportation</h4>
<p>In addition to its value as a precious metal for jewelry and currency, gold can be fashioned into a barrier against teleportation. While characters can teleport freely while carrying gold, but they cannot teleport through an opening framed in gold. Certain buildings thus often have thin strips of gold inlaid around doors and windows; typically, this gold is concealed by additional masonry or some other artistry. Prison cells meant to hold eladrin and others thought to be capable of teleportation are often surrounded by rings of gold.</p>
<p>Similarly, a creature wearing a gold ring — or bracelet, or even a thin thread of gold wire — cannot teleport or be teleported, so those wary of abduction might wear hidden gold toe rings to stymie wouldbe kidnappers. Simply carrying or wearing gold is not a problem unless it forms a full loop. Even with full circles of gold, the protection can be bypassed by simply removing part of the ring. This, combined with the temptation for thieves, keeps gold warding circles from being in common use.</p>
<h2 id="character-backgrounds">Character Backgrounds</h2>
<p>Since this is a story driven campaign, it is often a great benefit that your character has a great and rewarding backstory as well. You do not have to share these answers with your fellow players. However, please do share the answers with the DM so I can more tie your character into the plot and storyline during the campaign.</p>
<p>Write a basic background for the character. If you’re having trouble - make a checklist first. What was their childhood like? Adolescence? How wealthy were their parents (or guardians), and how were they treated? How long ago did they become an adult? What have they done to try and start a career as an adult (if anything)?  Make sure you cover the key points from your background selection from the PHB</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe at least two people that are tied to the character. One of them should be friendly to your character - a friend, a parent, a benefactor, etc. One of them should be hostile to your character - a rival, someone you owe money to…</li>
<li>How does your character interact with the others within a group?</li>
<li>What is your character’s role in a group? Is he the new guy? Have they met yet?</li>
<li>What are your character’s goals, conscious and, perhaps, subconscious?</li>
<li>How easily does your character love? Have they been in love?</li>
<li>Is your character racist at all, either now or in their past?</li>
<li>All people believe something that is not true, both about the world around them and about themselves. What lies/untruths does your character believe about themselves and the world around them?</li>
<li>How is your character about material possessions?</li>
<li>What does your character perceive their major problems to be?</li>
<li>What does your character perceive the solutions to those problems to be?</li>
<li>What are your character’s religious beliefs?</li>
<li>What does your character fear? It doesn’t need to be an object. Find something for your character that is a source of either shame or extremely hurt pride. Something that if it came out, your character just knows they’d be ruined, one way or another.  You owe a more than handsome sum to a bookie. You have a bastard child.</li>
<li>How much of a temper does your character have? What sorts of things set them off?</li>
<li>Where is his/her family? Do they have any siblings? Close friends? Who is important to them?</li>
<li>Describe a mannerism or quirk that your character has. If they’re a gambler, do they always have dice they carry? Do they have some kind of unfortunate verbal tic or speech impediment? Do they dress above or below their station? Is it obvious?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="character-themes">Character Themes</h2>
<p>Choose one of the nine themes below to provide a quick hook to link your character to the campaign. Your theme is in addition to your race, class, and background. It grants you a bonus feat.</p>
<h3 id="docker">Docker</h3>
<p><em><strong>Bohemian working-class artist or performer</strong></em></p>
<p>Flint’s industrial docks — with their unusual conflux of peasant workers, educated engineers, and constantly-arriving refugees from the wars in the border states between Danor and Drakr — have in the past decade given birth to an unorthodox social movement. Graffiti artists brighten soot-cloaked warehouses with colorful murals and boastful self-portraits. Dancers and musicians bolster moods in breezy bars, while amateur philosophers giddy on fey pepper entertain drunken teamsters with humorous moral puzzles that often mock public figures.</p>
<p>Occasionally these popular artists, called dockers, get it in their heads to start a riot or get a tad too precise with their criticism. The dockers and the city police have each taken their hits in these confrontations, and tensions grow higher with every accidental death, but for now Roland Stanfield, the city governor of Flint, seems to have a soft spot for these tepid anarchists.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-docker">Playing a Docker</h4>
<p>The docker spirit is not limited just to those who perform in public, but extends to anyone who suffers through hard work and low wages, yet can still appreciate intelligent art for its sublime beauty. The worse conditions get for the workers in Flint, though, the more they turn to dockers for relief from their fatigue. When things get heated, every good docker needs to be able to handle himself in a scrap.</p>
<p>Sometimes a docker gets in over his head, and with a little help from sympathetic bar owners or police officers he’ll drop out of the scene and find a new safer career. In this way, the docker movement has spread to pockets of the city slums and even out to the surrounding farmlands. One popular song on the docks even tells of a graffiti artist who fled to Crisillyir and is now painting cathedrals with subversive interpretations of the Clergy’s doctrines.</p>
<h4 id="feat-dockers-jank">Feat: Docker’s Jank</h4>
<p>In a band, every musician has to know his bandmates’ parts in case they need to switch places or pick up the slack. Choose up to four allies; you may change your chosen allies if you spend a few hours training with them. You and those allies can each use Help as a bonus action, but only to aid you or one of your chosen allies. Once a<br>
character uses this ability, he or she must take a short or long rest before doing so again.</p>
<p>Additionally, once per day as a bonus action you can shout a line from an inspiring song to grant an ally a Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level. Except for the limited use, this functions as the Bardic Inspiration feature.</p>
<h3 id="eschatologist">Eschatologist</h3>
<p><em><strong>Philosopher devoted to the proper endingsof things.</strong></em></p>
<p>The Heid Eschatol movement began among the dwarves of Drakr, after the scholar Vlendam Heid published a treatise on the myths of his<br>
nation and how they continued to influence modern perceptions. The book captured the culture’s consciousness, particularly a section that<br>
used the legend of the Lost Riders to explain the Drakran tradition of defining civilizations and eras by how they end. In the three decades<br>
since its publication, Heid’s “On the Proper Endings of Things” has given birth to a whole field of academic study devoted to finding the perfect way to end friendships and romances, business relationships, wars, serialized literature, and even one’s own life.</p>
<p>Heid’s disciples refer to themselves as eschatologists, from the term for the study of the end of the world. Their popularity has only strengthened Drakr’s existing obsession with apocalyptic prophecies and doomsaying, and has raised awareness of their beliefs in other nations. The Clergy, however, denies that the dwarven end times are near, and its agents take a dim view of Heid’s followers</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-eschatologist">Playing a Eschatologist</h4>
<p>Dwarves from any nation likely feel some sympathy toward Heid Eschatol, and soldiers who fought in the wars in the border kingdoms<br>
between Drakr and Danor often saw enough horrors that when they came home they were comforted by the thought of an orderly judgment day. A handful of apocalyptic cults have sprung up, and increasingly their members are seen less as fringe nuts and more as just another religious sect. Only a few outside of Drakr actually believe in<br>
a literal imminent end of the world, with most adherents simply appreciating the comfort they can find by confronting death with reason instead of fear.</p>
<p>Regardless of how a character was drawn to Heid’s movement, he is likely to give regular thought to the future, especially to life’s thresholds and endings. Every eschatologist regularly updates his will, and pays heed to his companions’ desires in the event of their untimely yet unavoidable deaths. A few race toward death, but most are pragmatic and take exceptional precautions to forestall any accidental demise that might ruin their plans.</p>
<h4 id="feat-proper-ending">Feat: Proper Ending</h4>
<p>With the dire knowledge that the world shall end in ice, you do what you can to prevent such fate from befalling your allies. As a bonus action, you can touch a dying creature or a creature that died in the past round. That creature is restored to life if dead, stabilizes, and is considered to have failed no death saving throws, but remains unconscious and has gained 1 point of exhaustion. The body must be relatively intact. This ability doesn’t function on decapitated or disintegrated creatures, for example.</p>
<p>As an action, you can concentrate on your own mortality in order to manifest a zone of cold in a 10-foot radius around you. Once manifested, the zone is stationary, and it lasts until you dismiss it as a bonus action, or you fall unconscious.</p>
<p>At the start of your turn, creatures in the zone take 1d6 cold damage. This increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level. Creatures in the zone cannot heal or gain temporary hit points. Since you manifested this fragment of the world’s icy end, you are affected by the zone even if you are not inside it, and you cannot reduce the damage this power deals to you by any means. Other creatures’ resistances and immunities can still protect them.</p>
<p>Once you manifest this zone, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
<h3 id="gunsmith">Gunsmith</h3>
<p><em><strong>Designer and wielder of custom firearms.</strong></em><br>
Knowledge of fusils — the cylindrical weapons that use explosive alchemical reactions to propel bullets at deadly speeds — has existed for<br>
centuries, but these weapons were considered inferior to existing magical attacks, which were more accurate and had less risk of accidental<br>
death. Only after the Great Malice did the Danoran military begin to refine and improve fusils. The latest innovations in these weapons,<br>
now commonly called “guns,” have led to their spread into Risur and Drakr, where industrial production helps equip armies with firepower on par with a well-trained sorcerer.</p>
<p>Firearms fascinate gunsmiths, who are not content simply to purchase and practice with guns. They tweak and tinker with their own refinements, and whenever two such craftsmen cross paths they bargain and deal for each other’s secrets. Especially now that firearms have moved beyond the null magic lands of Danor, seemingly limitless possibilities have opened up for the development of weapons that mix spellcraft and chemistry.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-gunsmith">Playing a Gunsmith</h4>
<p>Not all gunsmiths devote their combat training to wielding firearms; some just like to have the weapons for their aesthetic appeal, or to take advantage of the common man’s fear of their power. More often, though, gunsmiths practice endlessly to improve their aim, and try to learn as many trick shots as possible to prove the superiority of their chosen killing device. Those with magical training often master rituals to enchant their pistols. One gunsmith, Lerema Kurtz, is said to be able to conjure a cannon from her petticoat pocket.</p>
<p>Many romanticize the deadly purity of guns, or decorate their weapons with baroque inlays and carvings. A few gunsmiths, however, take a bleaker view, rejecting any form of poetry. They just know guns are damned good at killing people, and that life’s as good as worthless when a bullet costs less than a mug of beer</p>
<h4 id="feat-the-man-with-two-guns-is-god">Feat: The Man with Two Guns is God</h4>
<p>You have discovered the coolest fighting style in the world. You can draw and stow two firearms when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one. You can use two weapon fighting with dual pistols (or target pistols) just as with light melee weapons. Any creature you attack with a firearm cannot make opportunity attacks until the start of your next turn.</p>
<p>You are proficient in gunsmithing tools. Crafting common firearms only requires time and money. Crafting a grenade takes 25 gp of materials. Doing it safely takes 10 days of work, or you can rush it in 1 day, but then must succeed on a DC 10 Intelligence check or else the grenade explodes and injures you.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can craft target pistols, rifled carbines, or rifled muskets by paying half their price for raw materials, then spending a day for every 5 gp of total price to craft the item from scratch. Or you can take a normal firearm, spend 25 gp on a rifling kit, and successfully make a DC 10 Intelligence check to upgrade the weapon in a single day. If you fail this check, the weapon is ruined.</p>
<p>Whenever you take a long rest, choose two firearms in your possession to maintain. Those weapons cannot misfire for 24 hours</p>
<h3 id="martial-scientist">Martial Scientist</h3>
<p><em><strong>Educated and Analytical Warrior.</strong></em></p>
<p>In the war academies of Danor, students speak of combat like a science. Their curriculum involves not merely practicing forms and maneuvers, but writing theses about renowned warriors, or crafting and defending theorems regarding the mechanics of swordplay. The normally reserved Danorans honor the graduates of these battle colleges like other nations honor great poets and sculptors. As those warriors have proven the efficacy of their innovative techniques, the sentiment has spread throughout Lanjyr, and other nations have founded similar schools.</p>
<p>Any brute can hurl a spear or hack through a ribcage, but students of the war academies bring reason to the savagery of war. Often rising to high military ranks, these scholars of battle study anatomy and perform autopsies to learn vulnerabilities of the body, learn physical theorems that underlie the most effective angles of attack and defense, and take time to ponder the psychological and sociological considerations of mortal conflict — from the vast scope and human cost of an invasion, down to the emotional resonance and cultural significance of specific sword techniques through history.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-martial-scientist">Playing a Martial Scientist</h4>
<p>Danor has the greatest concentration of war colleges, but the Banhaman Academy in Risur’s capital Slate has a reputation for elite siege engineers and artillerists, and the Battalion outside of Flint trains the best wilderness forces in Lanjyr. Smaller local schools mostly serve to provide pensions for retired soldiers turned tutors, but even they have led to noteworthy theses, such as The Wounding Effectiveness of Stealthy Singular Rapier contrasted with a Twin Strike of Dual Long Swords, which provoked a very spirited debate and even a few expulsions when things got heated.</p>
<p>In Drakr, emphasis is given to testing the physiological limits of endurance and surviving in battle with limited resources, as would be likely in a world-ending conflict. The Clergy in Crisillyir add a strong theological and monstrous anatomy component to the students in their military academies. The lone war college in Ber has a vast library of battle songs, which according to a disputed theory will inspire the courage and attack accuracy of soldiers, though most likely it is just<br>
meant to keep in check the often wild emotions of its bestial students. You should work with your GM to determine what your graduate thesis was, unless you left before finishing your education.</p>
<h4 id="feat-martial-studies">Feat: Martial Studies</h4>
<p>Research is important for science and for combat. If you don’t know just the right fighting technique, you’re pretty sure someone else has published a thesis about it. You gain proficiency in one martial melee and one martial ranged weapon.</p>
<p>In addition, every martial scientist learns the Experimental Strike technique. During the campaign you will have the opportunity to learn new techniques. Keep track of which you know. At the end of a long rest, choose one technique you know. You have access to that technique for the day.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental Strike</strong><br>
Scientific breakthroughs are born of both careful study and wild experimentation. Whenever you use the Attack action and miss with every attack, you may make an improvised attack without spending an action, such as slicing a rope to pin an enemy with a chandelier, or smashing a pipe to spray blinding steam on an enemy. Make an Intelligence check and add your proficiency bonus; the GM determines the DC based on how difficult the task is. For example, dropping a chandelier straight down might very easy (DC 5), but slicing it, grabbing it to arrest its fall and make it jostle, then releasing it at the perfect moment so it swings laterally and flies at<br>
an enemy ten feet away might be hard (DC 20).</p>
<p>The GM should refer to the core rules for guidelines on the effects of improvised attacks. Circumstances will dictate how many foes are affected, how much damage is dealt, and whether any conditions can be applied (such as prone or blinded), but generally this should do at least “setback” damage.</p>
<p>After you use experimental strike you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h3 id="skyseer">Skyseer</h3>
<p><em><strong>Folk prophet who see the futures in the stars</strong></em></p>
<p>Truly ancient lore suggests that once the mortal races were able to travel to the stars with the aid of lost magic, much like demons and angels can be briefly summoned into this world. But for the full length of remembered history, the heavens have been nearly inscrutable. The druids, used to thinking in long terms of seasons, years, and the lifespan of trees, were the first to notice subtle connections between the movements of stars and the affairs of this world. They too were first to learn how to step through the veils that lead to the Dreaming or the Bleak Gate, and without their aid King Kelland could never have defeated the fey titans.</p>
<p>For over a thousand years, the druids would gaze into the sky night after night, awaiting dreams that would grant revelations of the future. These seers, by guiding journeyers and heroes with their visions, averted many catastrophes. When the Second Victory led to Srasama’s fall, the skyseers read the signs and helped hundreds of eladrin women flee their homeland so they could avoid genocide.</p>
<p>In the past few centuries, however, the many orders and factions of skyseers in Risur have struggled to divine much of import from the stars. Their visions, never precise or clear to begin with, failed to foresee the rise of Danor’s industry, failed to avert scores of natural disasters and man-made tragedies. The people of Risur still go through the motions of skyseer rituals, but the old druids’ influence has faded. Few young people today aspire to join their once-prestigious ranks.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-skyseer">Playing a Skyseer</h4>
<p>Those few who study to be skyseers today usually have a close mentor among the druids. Some may have spent countless nights as children staring up at the stars, before one night waking from a vivid, prophetic dream. Apprenticed to an elder skyseer, they learned the names of the stars and planets, their patterns and influence. Though precise visions are rare, it is still indisputable that magic of travel works better under the full moon, and that any ship that sets sail the night when Jiese enters retrograde within the constellation of the Mad Pirate will face great misfortune before it reaches its destination.</p>
<p>Skyseers favor the night, and with a glance at the starry sky can tell time as precisely as any clock. Even in this new age of technology, most Risuri ship’s captains won’t sail beyond sight of shore without a skyseer aboard. Though their influence has faded somewhat, they still have strong connections with many families, villages, and organizations, and they can easily find a welcome home — as long as they do not begin speaking of prophecies.</p>
<h4 id="feat-skyseer-vision">Feat: Skyseer Vision</h4>
<p>As a bonus action you may touch an ally and give them insight into future actions. The touched ally chooses one of the following — attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check — and then rolls a d20. The next time the ally would make the same type of roll before the end of the encounter, they may use the previously rolled result or opt to make a new roll. If the ally has advantage or disadvantage, only the first roll is replaced.</p>
<p>After using this ability you must take a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>
<p>As part of a long rest during which the night sky is visible, you may focus your mind on the future and receive a prophetic dream regarding one question. Upon completion of your rest you awaken with insights into the future as though you had cast a divination spell regarding a task you plan to take the following day.</p>
<h3 id="spirit-medium">Spirit Medium</h3>
<p><em><strong>One who contacts and controls the spirits of the dead</strong></em><br>
The Danoran industrial revolution has changed the ways of war, giving even the poorest man weapons that can kill the wealthy and wellequipped. Why then should not matters of the soul also move from the purview of the enlightened into the grasp of the common people? So ask spirit mediums, who wish to explain the mysteries of spirits and the afterlife so that men no longer need priests to tell them what awaits beyond death.</p>
<p>Certainly, many mediums are charlatans who prey on the weakness of bereaved aristocrats. But a few have discovered how to contact the dead through a form of psionic meditation called a séance. Some will only use their talents to help those who have a sincere need to know the secrets of the dead, and will only train students who share the same worldview, but most mediums reject such insularity as smacking of organized religion, and will gladly wake the dead for a quick chat at the drop of a few coins.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-spirit-medium">Playing a Spirit Medium</h4>
<p>The ability to speak with the recently departed is of great value to the Royal Homeland Constabulary, which recruits enthusiastically people with useful talents. Compared with the normal life of a medium, criminal investigators seldom have to convey messages between the dead and their living friends and relatives, though such conversations can help elicit otherwise unyielding secrets.</p>
<h4 id="feat-unfinished-business">Feat: Unfinished Business</h4>
<p>You possess a deep understanding of spirits and the ties that bind them to the mortal world. With the simplest of actions and words, you can stir the recently deceased into action.</p>
<p>With your urging, the spirit of a recently dead person will speak briefly with you. You can cast speak with dead. The body must be within three miles of where it died, and must not have died more than a day ago. You do not require a complete body as the ability speaks with the spirit and needs no corporeal connection. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>At the GM’s discretion, you could also use this power to communicate with uneasy spirits who have not yet moved on, regardless of how long ago they died. Using this power against undead, or in any combat situation for that matter, is possible but very difficult. By expending this power you can force an undead creature you can see to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). If it fails, you may take control of it for one round, as the dominate monster spell. Alternately you can call up the spirit of a creature whose body you can see that died in the past five minutes. It does not receive a save to resist. Its spirit manifests in a space you choose within 25 feet of you, and performs a single action of your choice as if it were still alive, then disappears.</p>
<h3 id="technologist">Technologist</h3>
<p><em><strong>Designer of contraptions and devices</strong></em></p>
<p>Some people cannot get enough of new technology. Those with talent tinker or create. Those without collect, study, or simply nag every engineer and inventor they meet. Whether dabblers or professionals, often these technology enthusiasts come up with ideas for devices that straddle the line between clever and impractical.</p>
<p>In Danor, academies train technologists in specialized fields, while in Drakr master dwarven craftsmen guide huge stables of apprentices in the massive engineering projects. Crisillyir punishes such tinkering with holy flagellation, and eladrin are as unsettled by technology as are the denizens of the Dreaming. A few enterprising technologists in Ber curry favor of the royal court, which responds eagerly to such intellectual pursuits.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-technologist">Playing a Technologist</h4>
<p>After centuries of reliance upon swords, bows, plate armor, and the occasional arcane evocation, keeping up with the modern pace of developing technology is daunting to many power groups, especially law enforcement and the military. Such groups might enlist technologists as specialists to explain unfamiliar devices, or to craft specialty weapons or tools. While the Danoran industrial revolution has massproduced many common tools and weapons, only a few have the knowledge and talent to create custom items. Technologists tend to gather lots of disposable tools and weapons, so that they always have something handy in an unusual situation. Many make a point to learn a bit of magic or alchemy as well, though every technologist is inspired by a different vision of what technology can provide.</p>
<h4 id="feat-disposable-simulacrum">Feat: Disposable Simulacrum</h4>
<p>By spending 10 gp to acquire the necessary parts, you can craft a contraption, which functions somewhat similarly to a familiar called by the find familiar spell. When deactivated it weighs 5 lbs. and can fit in a pouch or pocket, but you can infuse a bit of your life force into the contraption so that it becomes animate. As a bonus action, you can activate your contraption and place it in an unoccupied adjacent space, at which point it becomes a Tiny construct creature, with a form roughly similar to one of the animals available with find familiar. The contraption has that animal’s stats, with the following adjustments. It uses your AC and save bonuses (if higher), and its hit point maximum is 2 times your character level.</p>
<p>Your contraption acts on your initiative; it moves where you direct it. To get it to take any other action, such as Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help, you must spend an action to control it.</p>
<p>Additionally, your contraption can be designed to perform one special task, such as attacking with a natural or light weapon you integrate into its body, casting a single spell you store in it, or using some other ability (like Lay on Hands or Deflect Missiles) you have access to. You still must spend the appropriate type of action to have your contraption perform this task, and spells or abilities used through the contraption count towards your daily limit. Since it is bonded to you, however, the contraption performs this one special task as if you were performing the action in its space. Changing this special task requires an hour of tinkering. Changing the contraption’s shape requires eight hours at a properly furnished workshop.</p>
<p>You can only control one contraption at a time. Your contraption only functions while within 120 feet of you, beyond which it deactivates. While within that range, you can spend an action to see and hear from its space until the start of your next turn, during which time you are blind and deaf with regard to your own senses.</p>
<p>If reduced to 0 hit points, the contraption is automatically deactivated and you must spend an hour making repairs before you can activate it again. Replacing a lost contraption costs 10 gp and takes eight hours at a properly furnished workshop.</p>
<p>At 5th level you can spend 100 gp to craft a contraption in the shape of a Medium or smaller animal the larger the a weapon that can be integrated into its body.</p>
<h3 id="vekeshi-mystic">Vekeshi Mystic</h3>
<p><em><strong>Devotee of the philosophy of slow, proper vengeance against those who oppress the weak</strong></em></p>
<p>If fatalism defines the traditional dwarven philosophy, then the cornerstone of eladrin ideology is that living well is the best revenge.</p>
<p>After the goddess Srasama died and nearly all eladrin women perished with her, there was a great drive in Elfaivar to fight until the last man in a short-sighted bid for vengeance. As the rest of the nation whipped itself into a frenzy, however, a composer named Vekesh wrote a song of mourning that contained a simple sentiment: defeat is only tragedy if we choose to let the story end.</p>
<p>While many eladrins could not be stopped from their self-destruction, Vekesh convinced some of his people that a tale that goes from defeat to revenge to death is a shameful tragedy. Revenge serves only to distract from one’s grief, but is ultimately valueless. Instead, he said, a tale of defeat, resilience, and renewal is the best way to thwart their enemies’ goals.</p>
<p>The proper form of retribution, then, is to endure, rebuild from weakness, and prosper into strength.</p>
<p>His guidance ensured that in at least a few isolated enclaves, the eladrin race pulled back from the brink of annihilation. In the following decades a loosely codified collection of vekeshi teachings spread throughout Lanjyr. The mantras of Vekesh have helped many cope with loss and find a new path for themselves.</p>
<p>To the general public, though, ‘vekeshi’ is synonymous with murderer and terrorist. While the majority of vekeshi avoid violence when possible, Vekesh believed that taking up arms is sometimes necessary to protect those at their most vulnerable. The deepest secrets of vekeshi mysticism are taught only to a rare few adherents who demonstrate a skill for battle, and the wisdom to know when to use their power.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-vekeshi-mystic.">Playing a Vekeshi Mystic.</h4>
<p>Anyone might casually study Vekesh’s teachings for a bit of personal guidance, but to be initiated into the mystical side of the philosophy requires painful rituals. Aspirants are taken in the night across the threshold of the Dreaming, where they experience the fall of Srasama through psychic illusions, making them keepers of the shared memory of the Great Malice. Thereafter they are held in a cage for days, along with poisoned food that they must resist, so that the starvation teaches them the importance of patience. Finally, they are burnt until their skin blackens, and then are magically healed to seal in the power of the flames.</p>
<p>If a vekeshi passes these trials, he rests and recovers in luxury as his teachers instruct him in the secrets of the philosophy, and drill into him the necessity of discretion. Upon leaving the Dreaming, vekeshi mystics return to their normal lives, but seek positions of power in military, law enforcement, or the underworld, where they use their authority to punish those who continually threaten people who are simply trying to make a better life for themselves.</p>
<p>Vekeshi mystics seldom gather in large groups, but on certain irregular lunar holidays they slip into the Dreaming for secretive festivals. Only on the rarest occasions will a mystic be called to act openly. Donning an iconic mantle of eladrin armor and a mask that conceals his face, the mystic acts as the surrogate hand of the fallen goddess Srasama, with the sole purpose of meting out punishment against one directly responsible for large-scale suffering.</p>
<h4 id="feat-hand-of-retribution">Feat: Hand of Retribution</h4>
<p>You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill, or another skill if you already have Intimidation.</p>
<p>In battle, a vestige of the power of Srasama waits to punish those who harm your allies. When an enemy you’re aware of deals damage to one of your allies, as a reaction you can deal 1d4 radiant damage to the enemy who made the attack. That enemy sees a faint burning outline of a six-armed goddess hovering behind you, which then lashes out in retaliation with blades of fire. You cannot use this power twice against the same creature in the same encounter. After you use this power six times, you must take a long rest before you can use it again.</p>
<p>At 5th level, the damage increases to 1d4 radiant and 1d4 fire. At 11th level, the enemy also catches on fire and takes 1d4 fire damage each round until it spends an action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to put the fire out. At 17th level, using this ability does not require spending your reaction</p>
<h3 id="yerasol-veteran">Yerasol Veteran</h3>
<p><em><strong>Highly Regarded naval war hero</strong></em><br>
The islands of the Yerasol Archipelago were perhaps the most verdant, beautiful battleground in history. During two centuries of intermittent warfare, untold thousands of soldiers from Risur and Danor died among the windblown rainforests and flowered beaches of those isles, trying to protect their homelands’ exceedingly prosperous plantations. Those who survived — the ones who didn’t succumb to aberrant infections, crippling physical injuries, or unyielding mental trauma — often turned their war-time glory into profit or political clout.</p>
<p>Poets of the two nations have memorialized, and sometimes sensationalized, the greatest acts of heroism from the Four Yerasol Wars, the last of which ended seven years past. It’s an open secret that history is written by the survivors, and many so-called war heroes were merely lucky enough to witness something brave and amazing, and not die in the process so they could take the credit for themselves. A rare few, however, demonstrated genuine heroism and lived to have their tales told by others.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-yerasol-veteran">Playing a Yerasol Veteran</h4>
<p>Everyone knows the names of a few veterans who distinguished themselves in battle — not quite famous, but certainly memorable. Every veteran of the isles has a story that made him a celebrity, though many do not enjoy recounting their tales. The fact that everyone likes a war hero doesn’t lessen the trauma of having seen friends die.</p>
<p>After two centuries of trial and error, though, Risur and Danor have learned to exploit these heroes of the moment, giving them cushy jobs and helping them reacclimatize to civilian life. It doesn’t do to have a “hero” become a vagabond or a drunkard who will embarrass his nation, after all. The aid and adulation from their nation helps a great many Yerasol veterans become pillars of their communities. Such aid quickly dries up, though, should the hero ever decide to publicly criticize or cast aspersions upon his homeland.</p>
<h4 id="feat-display-of-heroism">Feat: Display of Heroism</h4>
<p>You unfortunately have great experience rescuing allies on the battlefield. As an action you can assist an ally who is imperiled. You can lift the ally to their feet if they are prone, and if you have any movement left for the turn you can drag the ally with you. Until the start of your next turn, as long as the ally remains beside you, any attacks made against that ally have disadvantage. Your heroic example can rouse your ally’s, even from the brink of consciousness, allowing the ally to spend a hit die to heal. Only 1 point is actual healing; the rest are temporary hit points.</p>
<p>At 5th level you can do this as a bonus action. At 10th level this no longer requires any action, though you can help no more than two allies this way per turn.</p>
<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>
<p>The new technological revolution has produced new weapons, and some items are unique to the Zeitgeist adventure path. More importantly to society at large, today is a civilized time, and fashion is important to showing one’s class.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gk8e1wcvlff0gig/equipmentCivilizedGear.PNG?raw=1">!CivilizedGear</a></p>
<p><strong>Fey Pepper</strong> This rare plant only grows near paths to the Dreaming, and since the fall of the Elfaivar Empire five hundred years ago it has been a black market item in most of Lanjyr. When chewed or smoked, the pepper makes the user giddy and upbeat. With a sufficient dosage, the user begins to hallucinate, though many claim these visions are actually glimpses into the Dreaming.<br>
<strong>Gentleman’s Outfit</strong> This fine outfit includes coat, vest, cane, top hat, and more. Gentlemen do not wear goggles.<br>
<strong>Goggles</strong> Designed for working in factories or laboratories with searing chemicals or embers, these goggles are atrocious for peripheral vision. While wearing them, you gain advantage on saving throws to resist effects that would blind you, but have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.<br>
<strong>Lady’s Outfit</strong> This ornate dress has an excess of weight composed of frills, whalebone corseting, multiple layers of fabric, and possibly a small hat with a lace veil. Still no goggles. Definitely no cogs either.<br>
<strong>Leaf of Nicodemus</strong> Monks cultivate this herb, which grows best on the islands of the Yerasol Archipelago. When crumbled, rolled, and smoked as a cigarette, the monk’s leaf soothes nerves and sharpens perception slightly. It can be addictive if used extensively, but has no social stigma, unlike fey pepper.<br>
<strong>Pocket Watch</strong> In addition to telling time, a pocket watch deters the attention of minor fey. Watches will occasionally stop, skip, or run backward in the presence of powerful fey creatures.<br>
<strong>Surgeon’s Kit</strong> Whenever you treat an injured ally during a short or long rest, you may make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. If you succeed, the first hit die that ally spends restores an additional 5 hit points. If you fail by 5 or more, that first hit die is wasted and restores no hit points.</p>
<h3 id="explosive-alchemicals">Explosive Alchemicals</h3>
<p>Early firearms used smoky gunpowder as propellant for its ammunition, but recent alchemical advances have produced firedust. This powdered variant of alchemist’s fire produces practically no smoke when used in firearms, has a lower risk of fouling or corroding the weapon’s internals, and is hydrophobic, allowing it to burn even after immersion in water.</p>
<p>Many other firearm accelerants exist, including magmite (a granular black substance rendered in alchemical furnaces) and phlogistite (translucent red vapor slime that floats in globules if exposed to open air), but firedust is by far the most widely used. Steam engines use a variant, firegems, which burn slower but longer</p>
<p>While it is the source of a firearm’s deadly power, firedust is relatively harmless as a weapon in its own right, since it burns too fast to cause serious wounds like traditional alchemist fire. If someone ignites a cask full of firedust, though, the resulting explosion could seriously hurt those nearby. The dwarves of Drakr field grenadiers who use hand-held explosives, but constables and even criminals find little use for such indiscriminate destruction in an urban environment.</p>
<h3 id="firearms">Firearms</h3>
<p>Firearms use explosive alchemicals to fire metal ammunition. Risur produces pistols, carbines, shotguns, and muskets from a variety of factories in Flint and elsewhere. Drakr possesses somewhat superior firearm technology, and it is possible to import (or custommake) grenades and rifled versions of normal firearms. Additional innovations such as metal cartridge ammunition are known to exist, but they are the domain of specialized gunsmiths, and as yet cannot be mass-produced.</p>
<p>For the sake of weapon proficiencies, grenades are considered simple weapons. Any character proficient with a hand crossbow is proficient with a pistol. Likewise, a light crossbow is equivalent to a carbine and shotgun, and a heavy crossbow is equivalent to a musket. Effects such as feats that specifically apply to crossbows also apply to firearms. (Note that every class except druids is proficient at least with light crossbows, so everyone but druids are able to use carbines and shotguns.)</p>
<h2 id="the-city-of-flint">The City of Flint</h2>
<p>The city of Flint is the heart of Risur’s industrial revolution, and it is the base of operations for your characters. You and your fellow players should have at least passing familiarity with the City.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Population</strong> — 800,000</li>
<li><strong>Head of Government</strong> — Governer Roland Stanfield</li>
<li><strong>Key Districts</strong> — The Aryes, Bosum Strand, Central District, The Cloudwood, The Nettles, North Shore, Parity Lake, Pine Island, Stray River</li>
<li><strong>Prominent Landmarks</strong> — Cauldron Hill, Parity Lake, Stanfield Canal</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qkdm3b0dhlb60v8/flint.PNG?raw=1">!Flint</a></p>
<h3 id="city-districts">City Districts</h3>
<p>Each district has its own mayor who handles local affairs, all of whom are elected except the mayor of The Nettles, whose additional role as guardian of the cursed Cauldron Hill requires he be appointed by the governor and approved by the king.</p>
<p>Districts also elect representatives to the city council, whose authority is balanced against that of the city governor, Roland Stanfield. Technically the position of governor is elected, but aside from brief periods after the deaths of various incarnations, Stanfield has held the position for over four centuries.</p>
<h4 id="bosum-strand">Bosum Strand</h4>
<p>Depending on who you ask, the name Bosum Strand comes either from the boatswains who frequented its taverns, or from the harbor’s more traditional name, which translated to bosom of the sea.</p>
<p>In either case, the docks along the east shore of Flint Bay are the heart of the city’s trade, culture, and crime. Hundreds of warehouses serve Flint’s merchant fleet, and dozens of bars, taverns, gambling houses, and brothels serve its dock workers. Craftsmen, artists, and money changers own shops surrounding several scattered public squares throughout the district, and the district’s mayor Griffin Stowe has strong-armed property owners along major streets to ensure that when the wealthy and influential travel the strand they are not forced to see any of the district’s uncouth underbelly.</p>
<p>This is why, of course, the dockers make a point to perform on as many street corners and squares as possible.</p>
<p>The district is currently clearing out tenants and demolishing buildings for a freight rail line. The station is already under construction, and once complete it will speed delivery of raw materials and natural exports. More importantly, it will let Flint share its industrial bounty with the rest of the nation. Unusually, many local druids have been recruited to speak with the spirits of the land</p>
<h4 id="central">Central</h4>
<p>The oldest and most developed district of Flint is home to its main government structures, including the city council, superior court, police headquarters, and the offices of various civil functionaries like tax collectors. Grand party halls, ornate druidic garden temples, and parks filled with monuments to old wars provide recreation and entertainment for the city’s nobility and prospering middle class, while the Orange Street commodities market and the prestigious Pardwight University are the dual hearts of Flint’s economic and academic cultures.</p>
<p>The district mayor Oncala Putnam recently approved construction of a grand subrail station to serve as the hub of a city-wide transportation network. Currently the Central district is often clogged with traffic from the surface rail station, since the proposed tunnel through Humble Hill in the Nettles, meant to provide an easier route to the factories of Parity Lake, has been dogged by sabotage from elements opposed to the industrialization of Risur.</p>
<p>Just off the coast in Flint Bay, the city governor’s mansion occupies what was once an island fortress. For the past 400 years Roland Stanfield has, through various incarnations and with only rare disruption, served as city governor, earning near universal respect for his wisdom and leadership.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Central district is home to the local headquarters of the Royal Homeland Constabulary, headed by Lady Inspectress Margaret Saxby.</p>
<h4 id="cloudwood">Cloudwood</h4>
<p>The eastern outskirts of Flint are dominated by towering mountains, their peaks constantly shrouded in clouds that feed lush rainforests and verdant streams. The steep highlands are sparsely populated, but numerous plantations and small farms fill the flatter terrain near the coast. Few city folk venture out to these lands, believing that here the veil between the real world and the Dreaming is thin. Local myths include countless tales of farmers, travelers, and juvenile miscreants who wander into the foggy woods and suffer wretched fates at the hands of capricious fey.</p>
<p>While most who live in Cloudwood consider it common courtesy to share a bowl of milk or plates of sliced fruit with unseen nightly visitors, the district’s new mayor, Doyle Idylls, has forbidden district employees from engaging in the old tradition. Mayor Idylls shares his office with the local police branch, and he recently had salt baked into bricks around its base in order to keep away curious fey. Soon after, the building developed a gopher problem.</p>
<p>Though criminals in Flint tend to make the Nettles their first stop when on the run from the law, those who really need to lay low find the wild rainforests of Cloudwood ideal. The most rural areas of the district are practically independent thorps and hamlets, many of which are sympathetic to desperate outsiders.</p>
<h4 id="the-nettles">The Nettles</h4>
<p>A small spur of the mountains of the Cloudwood cuts into the heart of Flint, and for most of the city’s history these hills were home to druidic rituals, or simply let romantics witness wondrous vistas of the beaches from on high. Their traditional name came from an old commander of the Flint fort, who saw them as a thorny barrier against attack from the north.</p>
<p>But then in 346 a.o.v. a coven of witches took residence upon a jagged mountain at the range’s edge, which ever since has been called Cauldron Hill. For decades they terrorized the city, sending goblins and specters to abduct people for sacrificial rites, then hiding in the veil between this world and the Black Gate whenever any tried to assault them. Eventually the witches were defeated when King Lorcan allied with a Crisillyiri godhand and led an assault during a lunar eclipse. Ever since, the peak of Cauldron Hill has been rife with haunting and spirit activity, and one of the key tasks of the district mayor has been to keep daring fools from ascending the mountain and coming down possessed.</p>
<p>The greatest achievement of the previous district mayor was constructing a highway across Humble Hill to make travel across the city easier, but in the past few decades the district, even the base of Cauldron Hill itself, have grown thick with slum housing, as more and more people flock to Flint hoping to find work in the factories. The broad switchbacks of the highway are cluttered with shacks, often with two or three families sharing the same building. Poorly crafted houses cling to the sides of slopes, and they have become a nightmare for local police to patrol, giving a whole new connotation to the name “The Nettles.”</p>
<p>Current district mayor Reed Macbannin has been unable to halt the new arrivals, and he hasn’t been helped by the common prejudice that the factory workers are prone to crime, laziness, and general mayhem. Despite this, he has managed to earn passing respect from the people of his district; few are trusted with the stewardship of Cauldron Hill, and he has leveraged his office to get city tax money for the poorest of the poor.</p>
<h4 id="north-shore">North Shore</h4>
<p>The sun rises through the mists of Cloudwood, banishing the night with pale purple clouds dashed by the golden gleam of dawn. Fresh sea breezes sweep the gloomy haze of soot away from pristine beaches, letting clear daylight fall upon gently crashing waves. The day wanes, and the sky explodes with crimson and vermilion as the sun sets behind the twin peaks of Great Horned Mountain. Night drapes a starry curtain across the world, and still the waves gently lap upon the North Shore.</p>
<p>Home to the most beautiful urban beaches in all of Lanjyr, Flint’s North Shore district prides itself on its appearance, despite being so close to the polluted Parity Lake. Demand for beachside property has pushed out all but the wealthiest land-owners, those who can afford to hire druids to pray for favorable winds to keep the smoke at bay, and armies of cleaning crews to scrub their walls and streets when the druids fail.</p>
<p>Of course with wealth comes corruption and temptation. Young girls end up dead in alleys. Criminals stage daring robberies of villas protected by curses. Destitute nobles, dragged down from their towers by the machinations of rivals, stumble from nighttime streets into strangely-scented shops they’d never seen before and find offers they cannot refuse.</p>
<p>The district mayor, Aaron Choir, unabashedly serves the interests of the wealthy, and he is currently petitioning to build a wall between North Shore and Parity Lake to keep out “undesirables.” Likewise, police violently deter the occasional protest that crops up outside the Danoran consulate, which sits a few blocks inland from the shore. Mayor Choir is careful, of course, not to appear too friendly with the unpopular Danorans, no matter how much they pay him in kick-backs.</p>
<h4 id="parity-lake">Parity Lake</h4>
<p>When Flint first began building factories, this inland lake, fed by run-off from the Nettles, was chosen by Governor Stanfield. A massive construction project widened and deepened a natural river that ran from the lake to the Bosum Strand harbor, providing easy transit of manufactured goods out of — and coal or heating oil into — the district. Homes of fishermen on the lake were demolished, while new flophouses and stacked tenements were erected for the waves of people who came from around the country seeking work in the new factories. Wealth poured into the city’s coffers, and into the pockets of those canny enough to lease their land here, rather than sell it.</p>
<p>During the Fourth Yerasol War seven years ago, factories in Parity Lake mass-produced firearms, cannons, and other weapons, and a lumber mill transformed logs from the Cloudwood into components for shipyards in Bosum Strand. New factories sprang up to create armor for men and ships, and soon even steam engines were being churned out to retrofit Risur’s fleet.</p>
<p>The war effort transformed Parity Lake from a booming collective of new businesses to a crowded, foul-smelling, soot-choked warren, over-crowded with the children of now second-generation factory workers, surrounding a pool that every day more resembles sludge than water. The police manage to keep crime down through heavy-handed measures; the district’s mayor Rosa Gohins has publicly stated that the safety and stability of the factories are more important than the moral of the factory workers.</p>
<h4 id="pine-island">Pine Island</h4>
<p>Though the ground of most of Flint’s coast is rocky and hilly, the western coast of the bay has a strange sprawling bayou surrounding dozens of short granite hill-islands. Pine Island takes its name from the aquatic pine trees that anchor the bits of dry land throughout the bayou, though the hills are mostly grassy ranchland. Not as well known or developed as the bustling east coast, this district nevertheless plays a significant role in the city’s business.</p>
<p>While Bosum Strand handles industrial and textile trade, Pine Island services hundreds of plantations in its soggy lowlands and small ranches in its western hills. The main docks on Flint Bay are practically a floating city of wooden bridges and stone anchors, which has slowly grown away from the silt of the bayou to better serve deep-water merchant ships. Further inland, complicated streets, connected by ferries and bridges, weave between islands ranging from the size of a single house to a small neighborhood.</p>
<p>Criminals ply the waters of the bayous in shallow boats, often parking ships of smuggled drugs, magic, or women just off shore, then taking circuitous routes through the flooded forests in order to bypass dock authorities. While most dock-side businesses are legitimate, deeper in the bayou you can find gambling houses, brothels, and fey pepper dens.</p>
<p>Farther west, where there are no longer even occasional hills, the Battalion academy trains elite soldiers and martial scientists in the ways of war, with an emphasis on wilderness survival and the best techniques of intimidation against an occupying force. The district’s mayor, Roger Pepper, is a graduate. Many of the Battalion’s teachers served in the Yerasol Wars and various skirmishes.</p>
<h4 id="stray-river">Stray River</h4>
<p>The cluster of businesses and homes where Stray River empties into the bay is the closest thing to a typical Risuri city one can find in Flint. The Stray River district has well-tended streets, quaint two-story brick houses, and enjoys easy prosperity as the place most visitors to the city stay. The district is also home of some of the oldest mills in Risur, powered by small canals that loop off the main river to avoid disrupting water traffic.</p>
<p>One strange attraction of the district is the Penny Pyre. Originally it was a small blackened pit, where a mage’s accident caused copper to burn as easily as wood, but last far longer. When the effect persisted, it became a fixture of the district’s festivals. Various copper sculptures are designed by the districts artisans and placed atop the pit to burn over the course of hours or days. On normal occasions, people will occasionally toss a spare copper coin into the pyre for good luck. The royal mint has tried to end the practice, but the district’s mayor, Chrystine Robinson, defends the tradition, saying more coins are simply lost in the dirt than tossed in the pyre.</p>
<h4 id="the-ayres">The Ayres</h4>
<p>North of the city lie a clear island chain and several satellite islands. Many of these are merely rocky sandbars with a few trees, but a few larger islands serve as remote villas for the city’s wealthiest. Nobles hold many family estates here, though one island is owned by a man new to his money: Guy Goodson, who swindled his initial wealth from a dozen naïve villages, and invested early in Flint’s industrial boom. Today he owns dozens of factories in Parity Lake, and regularly dines with his noble neighbors, who delight in the small steamboat he uses to visit them.</p>
<p>Since technically The Ayres is considered part of North Shore, it does not have its own district mayor. In practice, law and government officials never bothers the nobles on their islands unless an equally wealthy or powerful individual lodges a complaint.</p>
<h3 id="the-military">The Military</h3>
<p>The Battalion school of war in the bayous of Pine Island trains hundreds of future officers every year, and works in connection with various district forts throughout the city, as well as naval bases on an island near the mouth of Flint Harbor. Flint still remembers a few naval skirmishes that threatened shipping eight years ago, and so the military maintains a constant watch for possible threats. Normally, though, they will not respond unless a district mayor or the city governor himself calls on them.</p>
<p>While few individual soldiers have magical training, the military has acquired over the years a wide variety of enchanted weapons and defenses. Perhaps foremost among these, every soldier stationed in The Nettles district fort is given an amulet to ward them against supernatural influence, should they be called upon to face a reawakening of the eldritch horrors that reigned over Cauldron Hill during the time of the witches.</p>
<p>The local commander of Flint land forces is Colonel Greg Masterson, while the naval defenses are overseen by Rear Admiral Morris Dawkins.</p>
<h2 id="royal-homeland-constabulary">Royal Homeland Constabulary</h2>
<p>RHC constables are law enforcement officers tasked with protecting Risur from serious threats, usually in the form of foreign plots, magically- equipped criminals, and various supernatural foes everyday police are not capable of handling. The directorate in Flint generally keeps busy thwarting arms smuggling, industrial espionage, and the sorts of magical and monstrous threats once handled by plucky self-motivated “adventurers.”</p>
<h3 id="authority-and-the-law">Authority and the Law</h3>
<p>Constables are invested with the authority of the king, and so are granted great leeway in their pursuit of justice and safety. While normal police must acquire warrants before they can search a building, RHC constables are trusted to not abuse their authority, and so can act as swiftly as needed. However, they are required to fill out proper paperwork and give testimony justifying their actions. A constable who uses his power for personal gain — or to harass anyone of political clout without good reason — will find himself penalized, demoted, and possibly even in prison.</p>
<p>Constables are expected to take suspects alive whenever possible. Do note that the Fifth Edition rules allow characters to choose to subdue an enemy rather than kill it when it’s reduced to 0 hit points, so long as they use a melee weapon and are within 5 feet of the target. Execution is a likely punishment if a trial deems a suspect to be an enduring threat, though some criminals with political value might be kept under special house arrest, as long as they do not actively pursue plots against Risur.</p>
<p>Every constable has access to binding ropes as well as handcuffs (albeit not quite as advanced as the modern variety). Most handcuffs include gold wire or thread, which can be tied off after the cuffs are closed to prevent creatures from teleporting while wearing them. In special cases, magical restraints can be requisitioned.</p>
<p>Constables can usually hand over arrested suspects to the police, though the RHC headquarters in Flint does have specially prepared cells to handle more dangerous criminals. These cells are all lined with enchantments similar to those of mage-cuffs, and are surrounded by rings of gold and bricks baked with salt and other warding agents. When needed, even more specialized items can be used, such as chains that can hold incorporeal entities or prevent shapechanging, hoods that block gaze attacks, and sigils to nullify innate energy threats like flaming elementals.</p>
<p>When it comes to interrogations, this is not a modern police force. Characters who choose to be enlightened and use less-violent approaches can often get what they need with less hassle, but threats and actual violence are common tools when trying to make suspects talk, and most superiors won’t bat an eye as long as no one is seriously injured or dies.</p>
<h3 id="loyalty-to-risur">Loyalty to Risur</h3>
<p>The RHC recruits from police, military, universities, and many other sources of talent, occasionally even accepting foreign applicants. In addition to requiring extensive background checks, recruits must undergo a magical inquisition. The king grants each branch’s local director the ability to test the loyalty of all who would apply to join the constabulary.</p>
<p>A candidate who agrees to undertake the test opens their mind so the director may sense their true intentions. If they have any ill will to Risur, its people, or its leaders, it will be revealed. More importantly, the candidate must show a devotion to protecting Risur. Risur need not be the primary concern of the applicant — people are expected, after all, to value their family, friends, even careers — but this precaution has kept the RHC from ever having produced a traitor in the thirty years it has been active.</p>
<h3 id="hierachy-and-teams">Hierachy and Teams</h3>
<p>Approximately twenty constables are active in the Royal Homeland Constabulary’s Flint directorate, supported by almost a hundred researchers, office assistants, laboratory technicians, security guards, carriage drivers, and the like.</p>
<h4 id="leadership">Leadership</h4>
<p>The Flint branch is run by Lady Inspectress Margaret Saxby, a former superstar investigator who cracked many famous cases, became the darling of the public, and earned herself a knighthood. During the Fourth Yerasol War she married a young nobleman, acquiring clout among aristocratic circles. When the then-director of Flint’s branch of the RHC lost favor in a scandal, she easily won the appointment to take his place.</p>
<p>Lady Saxby leads her branch with incisive intelligence and an experienced intuition for determining which of her constables should pursue which threats. On the other hand, some complain that her confidence borders on megalomania. On several occasions underlings who have become a bit too popular for her liking have received transfers to less prestigious postings.</p>
<p>At nearly fifty, Lady Saxby remains quite fit and retains youthful beauty. She demands authority wherever she goes, and uses many subtle reminders to let people know who is boss. For example, there is only one (expensive, comfortable) chair in her office: hers.</p>
<h4 id="units-and-oversight">Units and Oversight</h4>
<p>Saxby’s role as director often has her dealing with bureaucrats and nobles, and while she officially is also the Chief Inspector, she leaves most affairs of investigations to Assistant Chief Inspector Stover Delft, who oversees four units of constables and coordinates their activities.</p>
<p>A local Flinter in his early 40s, Delft gets squinty and condescending when his authority is questioned, but he recognizes talent and good work. Since his own days as a constable, Delft has served a vital role handling logistics; in the past few years he’s even acquired a modicum of leadership skill. He often expresses pride for three of his old underlings who went on to head spy cells overseas.</p>
<h4 id="npcs-you-might-now">NPCs you might now</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carlao</strong> a human veteran of the Fourth Yerasol War who proudly wears his plate armor even in the city. He’s something of a director’s pet, and acts as Saxby’s trusted aide.</li>
<li><strong>Serena</strong> a human tinkerer who often crafts gadgets useful for spying and “wet works,” but is surprisingly cheery, seeing all female constables as her sisters.</li>
<li><strong>Kaea</strong> an eladrin evoker widely distrusted by the local fey and druids after she went undercover among the skyseers to expose a vekeshi murderer.</li>
<li><strong>Dima</strong> a dwarf priest with an unhealthy fondness for filing paperwork.</li>
<li><strong>Josiah</strong> a human sniper constantly fiddling with his rifle when he’s not on mission seducing people of interest.</li>
<li><strong>Gaethan</strong> a half-elf ranger whose ability to speak with the dead has made him a bit addled and unreliable, having to carry a notebook to remind himself of his daily affairs</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-setting">The Setting</h2>
<p>It was Risur’s traditional enemy Danor—bereft of magic after a cataclysm five centuries past—which began the industrial revolution. Their steam-powered ships and deadly cannon fusillades won them many battles, but the artificers of Flint are combining magic and industry in ways impossible for their enemies, and the tiefling oligarchy of Danor seems content with the land it has acquired. Many of the other great nations, however, fear what Risur can achieve with the marriage of magic and technology, and King Aodhan of Risur worries they might try to disrupt his nation’s safety and prosperity.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the dwarven homeland Drakr preaches of a nihilist doomsday and sells technomantic arms and war machines to warlords and mercenaries across the land. The clergy of theocratic Crisillyir loathe Danor and its tiefling leaders, and they wield piety as a lash to inflame distrust of what they claim is a godless abomination. Just across a mountain border to Risur’s south, the warlike clans of Ber have formed an alliance, which might signal a coming invasion. Even in distant Elfaivar, where the small Risuri colony named Kellandia struggles against settlers from other nations to claim the broken empire’s bounty, the natives lash out at these interlopers, unable to forgive a centuries-old grievance still fresh in their long-lived hearts.</p>
<h3 id="risur">Risur</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qtspa3l2mwq25e8/flagRisur.PNG?raw=1">!Flag of Risur</a><br>
Every Risuri child knows that before King Kelland, no human nation had ever endured more than a few years in Lanjyr. The mighty nature spirits known today as the fey titans only allowed the elves to walk their domain, and they terrorized all others with beasts and storms and blight. But in 1200 b.o.v. (Before Our Victory), Kelland subdued the lord spirits of field and forest, of marsh and mountain. With their grudging blessings, he established Risur.</p>
<p>The people of Risur offered the spirits tithing and tribute, and eventually lulled them to sleep. What were once uncharted wilds of fierce beasts and tiny enclaves of elves became a prosperous bastion of humanity. In the seventeen centuries since, Risur’s rites of rulership have ensured that Kelland’s crown only passes to those mighty enough to cow the land’s primal spirits should they ever seek to reclaim their domain.</p>
<h4 id="land-and-culture">Land and Culture</h4>
<p>Risur is a subtropical country, possessed of vast forests and fertile fields fed by hundreds of rivers and streams which flow from the southern Anthras Mountains to the northern shore of the Avery Sea. Temperatures are warm but comfortable year-round, though a rainy season strikes near the end of what the northern nations consider summer.</p>
<p>Even the poorest Risuri can enjoy fresh fruit all year round. Wealthy foreigners cherish Risur’s pineapples, limes, bananas, and massive jackfruit, but most prized are its cocoa and sugarcane, and alcohols made of each. A typical Risuri meal consists mostly of fruit, beans, bread, and fish, with the occasional beef or pork. Factory workers in Flint seldom can afford quality meat, and instead make savory stews by soaking bones and sausages in dark beans. Holiday celebrations often include steaming milk flavored with either chocolate or honey.</p>
<h4 id="terrain">Terrain</h4>
<p>Four main landscapes make up Risur. The northern Avery Coast is dominated by a mix of wooded beaches — where mountainous granite domes rise out of the sea and anchor dry lands — and forested swamps, often referred to by the native Elven word bayou — where the country’s many rivers sweep soil out into broad floodlands.</p>
<p>The Weftlands of Risur are low plains covering most of the western two-thirds of the country, which draw their name from the countless rivers that weave toward the sea like yarn in a cloth. Most towns and farms lie here, though pockets of wild forests and rocky hills create uninhabitable divides between provinces.</p>
<p>The land rises to the south, and in the mid-altitude hills an unusual swamp wriggles across the landscape, known as the High Bayou. Though the hills are uneven, huge numbers of nesting beasts and giant insects have dammed swaths of the land, slowing the rivers that flow out of the mountains and ensuring a steady source for rivers year-round. Few Risuri live here aside from villages of elves who never integrated with the rest of the nation.</p>
<p>Beyond the High Bayou, the rain-carved Anthras Mountains forms a broad border with Ber. Forests cover most of these mountains, though mining in the east has stripped many peaks. Centuries of attacks from Ber have kept many towns from flourishing here.</p>
<h4 id="flint-city-of-industry.">Flint, City of Industry.</h4>
<p>The industrial powerhouse of Flint sits nestled among dozens of granite peaks along the eastern stretch of Avery Coast. With a rapidly-growing population of over half a million, slums for factory workers have begun to clump along these steep hills, while builders work to clear large sections of rainforest from within the city limits. Small satellite towns cling to the islands outside Flint’s harbor, and many foreign nations and businesses have flocked to the city to gain influence in the past forty years.</p>
<h4 id="slate-the-historic-capital">Slate, the Historic Capital</h4>
<p>Risur’s capital of Slate lies on the banks of the Great Delve River, in verdant plains fifty miles from the Avery Sea. It is by far the largest city in the country, with a population of nearly a million people. A half-dozen major highways converge on Slate, including the King’s Road. Slate is still the heart of Risur’s internal trade and business, though more and more international trade goes through Flint.</p>
<p>For people used to living in the bustle of Flint, the city of Slate appears stately, calm, and perhaps a bit doddering. The Great Delve River, with its steep banks turning it almost into a man-made channel, generally separates the city into the noble west bank and the common east bank.</p>
<p>Six antique castles sit along the inside of a wide bend on the river’s west bank, arranged in a pattern originally designed to defend against invasion. Each castle acts as a nexus of a community of elite gated villas, and here live the nobles descended from the many kings and queens Risur has had throughout history. Today the district resembles an overly-manicured flower garden, more pretty than practical.</p>
<h4 id="other-cities">Other Cities</h4>
<p>Other prominent Risuri cities include the beleaguered Shale on the western coast near the war-wracked Yerasol Archipelago, where druids keep wary watch from sandy barrier islands and shipyards assemble the mightiest sailing vessels in the world; and lumber-rich Bole in the Antwalk Thicket southeast of Slate, source of some of the finest food and theater, and host to finely cultivated forest gardens.</p>
<p>Both cities were once capitals of their own smaller nations in ancient times, before joining with Risur, yet they were always connected by water routes. The Great Delve’s tributaries start near Bole, and the river only widens and deepens as it passes Slate and eventually pours into the sea near Shale.</p>
<p>A dozen other cities with a hundred thousand or more people dot the coastlines, and a few more flourish along the most traversable rivers, but much of the country’s interior is rural.</p>
<h4 id="transportation">Transportation</h4>
<p>The numerous rivers across the country hold great potential for trade inland that has not yet been realized. Most trade occurs along the coast, with rivers primarily used to carry lumber downstream to shipyards. Every new king or queen expresses an interest in expanding settlements into the more rural regions, but vast swaths still remain uninhabited.</p>
<p>One development that might change that is the introduction of railroads. Though rail travel is far more prevalent in Danor and Drakr, a few lines have been constructed across Risur, usually traveling perpendicular to the flow of rivers. The most developed line runs from mines in the Anthras Mountains to Flint, helping to feed its hunger for raw industrial materials. Many traditionalists, however, oppose the expansion of the railroad and warn that its churning wheels will anger the native fey.</p>
<h4 id="race-and-religion">Race and Religion</h4>
<p>The humans of early Risur outfought or outgrew the native elves, though many elves and half-elves call the land home today. The sub-men races from what is today Ber — gnolls, goblins, kobolds, minotaurs, and orcs — survive in pockets, often as the descendants of slaves taken in old wars, now freed but not accepted.</p>
<p>Some families of halflings mingle with humans in farming communities, and dwarves similarly in mining towns. Tieflings receive an odd mixture of fear and respect, though common folk tend to believe their influence on the nation is dangerous. Other races are too rare for most people to recognize them, and are generally lumped together with eladrin as being distrusted “fey.”</p>
<p>Risur’s main religion is a mix of old human pantheism, elven druidic rites, and reverence for local fey titans who slumber in the earth. Centuries ago many gave worship to the eladrin gods or even archfey who claim to be emissaries of the fey titans, but after the fall of Elfaivar in the Second Victory a cultural shift has taken hold across the whole continent away from fey icons.</p>
<p>For most of Risur’s history, their most respected religious leaders were the skyseers, druids who devoted themselves to understanding patterns in the stars. The skyseers offer guidance and occasionally proclaim prophecies to guide kings, lords, and common folks alike. But the skyseers have many sects, and in the past century their prophecies have grown more and more vague. Many still respect them, but they no longer hold the same political power they once did.</p>
<p>Some elements of the millennium-old Clergy faith have taken root in Risur, in particular the Great Man doctrine, which sits well with a people whose first king personally changed the course of history. However, Risuri reject the Clergy’s elaborate celestial hierarchy of planar domains and stars, which states the dots in the night sky are actual worlds of their own. To the Risuri, such belief reduces the prominence of the mortal races, instead placing greatest import on beings from realms no human has ever visited.</p>
<h4 id="monarchy-and-government">Monarchy and Government</h4>
<p>Risur’s current monarch, King Aodhan, rules from Torfield Palace in Slate. Now in his seventies, Aodhan was only thirty when the previous king chose him as his successor. Aodhan had distinguished himself in the Third Yerasol War against Danor, performing feats of strength and heroism most today assume are just tall tales.</p>
<p>Aodhan has always been fascinated by Danor’s technology, ever since he lured its first steampowered warship into a kraken’s reef lair, waited for the crew to abandon ship, then beat back the kraken and single-handedly piloted the vessel—still bearing scars of the kraken’s tendrils—to the harbor of Flint. (Or at least, that’s one story of how it happened.) Once he took the crown, Aodhan pushed for industrial investment to keep up with Danor, but regional governors forced him to keep foreign technologies out of Slate. Flint became the next most obvious choice.</p>
<p>King Aodhan’s aged wife died four years ago. Though heredity and marriage has little impact on national succession, many wonder whether the king will seek a new bride so late in life. Despite his great strength in his youth, the king grows weaker each year.</p>
<p>Many suspect he will name his younger sister Duchess Ethelyn of Shale as his replacement, and indeed she has distinguished herself as a leader in the Fourth Yerasol War that ended seven years ago, even though her city nearly fell to Danor. She is rumored to have close ties to the Unseen Court, and acts as Risur’s ambassador to its nearest neighboring nation. However, her coronation would be the first in Risur’s history that transferred the crown between two blood relatives.</p>
<h4 id="politics">Politics</h4>
<p>Twenty-three governors direct the affairs of Risur’s various provinces. Most of these are of noble lineage, descended from one of the nation’s previous kings. Noble governance tends to follow family lines, unlike the crown. Each governor sends several representatives to the national Parliament, which handles the details of implementing the king’s decrees and can with a supermajority overrule them. Various officers of the court and of Parliament direct specific sub-bureaucracies and agencies to handle affairs involving the nation’s commerce, culture, defense, and so on.</p>
<h5 id="history-and-place-in-the-world">History and Place in the World</h5>
<p>Risur paved the way to nationhood, and many others followed the same path. By placating the dominant fey titans of Lanjyr they turned the continent into a land for mortals. The Risuri people have always respected the spirits and the fey they share the land with, but they believe the era of those beings has rightfully passed.</p>
<p>While the northern nations waged holy wars between the Clergy and the Seedism faith of Elfaivar,Risur was preoccupied defending its borders from the sub-men of what is modern Ber. The dragons who terrorized the lands south of the Anthras Mountains feared the progress of civilization, and would often gather armies of savages to raid or assault Risur. It is believed that two centuries ago King Boyle slew the last great dragon of Ber, after which attacks from the south finally faded.</p>
<p>No sooner had Risur found safety to its south than did Danor arise in power to the north. Risur and Danor have warred for nearly two hundred years, mostly using the islands of the Yerasol Archipelago as a proxy battle ground, in a series of four Yerasol Wars. Occasional waves of conquest have lapped over each nation’s shores, and today the two countries have more in common than either likes to acknowledge. The current king assumed the throne at the end of the Third Yerasol War, four decades ago, and he presided over the fourth, in which Risur lost much land against the threat of Danor’s superior technology.</p>
<p>Leaders of Risur’s merchant guilds, its military, and its noble families are grateful for the stability, but fear a resumption of hostilities. They have taken advantage of the new international cordiality in order to catch up with Danor’s technological revolution. Whether the next threat comes from Danor or another foe, Risur is arming.</p>
<h3 id="ber">Ber</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/f9w11y0n5lq80vp/flagBer.PNG?raw=1">!Flag of Ber</a></p>
<p>Ber’s history is tied to dragons. Until just a few centuries ago, the land was in constant flux, with different dragons battling for supremacy while the mortal races served as their slaves. Tribes of dragonborn, gnolls, goblins, kobolds, minotaurs, and orcs ascended to tiny nation states under the banners of their draconic overlords, built cities and strip-mined mountains to gather wealth for these kings, and eventually collapsed into chaos when their rulers fell. Newborn nations conquered each other like a ring of serpents devouring their tails, and whenever a dragon had willpower enough to unite all of Ber, it would inevitably make the mistake of pressing into Risur or Elfaivar, and be slain in retaliation.</p>
<p>Despite the endless turnover of rulers, Ber did manage to establish a few long-lasting cities— Ursaliña, Reo Pedrecoso, and the capital Seobriga, among others—and develop a shared culture, often thanks to wandering minotaur bards who were seen as neutral. After the death of the last dragon king Inatch the Hex-Eater two hundred years ago, Ber splintered into racial and tribal factions. Only in the past forty years has a semblance of unity returned to the land.</p>
<h3 id="crisillyir">Crisillyir</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9x3ygrockibqdme/flagCrisillyir.jpg?raw=1">!Flag of Crisillyir</a></p>
<p>Crisillyir is ruled by the hierarchs of the Clergy, the religion that freed the nation from demonic rule a millennium ago. Today, Crisillyir is a rich land, its fields bountiful, its coffers full of colonial gold. Centuries of divine rituals have turned its great cities into beacons of enlightenment and magical research, though this prosperity seems to attract attention from supernatural threats. Elaborate aqueducts feed water from the snowcapped Enfantes Mountains throughout the nation; it is said that each column in the aqueduct system is engraved with one chapter from the Clergy’s holy book, acting as a massive ward against the ancient evil that still lurks in the land.</p>
<p>In Crisillyir, the power of the church is supreme, but not unquestioned. While the grand summoners conjure forth tortured specters from the Bleak Gate to cow their flocks into piety, collegial arcanists debate conceptions of the cosmos that do not match church dogma. Fat merchant lords pay lip service to the faith, sell weapons and ritual components to eladrin assassins, then purchase indulgences to absolve themselves. And though the inquisitive halo-bearing geneu credetos (‘spirits of belief,’ or more commonly ‘godhands’) are tasked with guarding the nation from unholy, fey, and undead influences, criminal organizations nevertheless manage to smuggle in contraband and use resurrections to extort even the dead.</p>
<h4 id="the-clergy">The Clergy</h4>
<p>According to the church’s holy text, one thousand years ago a human fisherman named Triegenes from what today is Danor discovered the secret of divinity while lost in a storm at sea. He returned and preached about the divine spark within all mortals, and how by constantly challenging oneself, a person can become like a god. He inspired followers to fight beside him, and together they toppled tyrants, slew legendary monsters, and eventually established a new nation, based upon a hierarchy of divinity, where rank and reward were based solely on merit.</p>
<p>After his kingdom was established, Triegenes undertook the greatest challenge left in the mortal world: to defeat the Demonocracy that oppressed the lands to the east. He confronted the abyssal lords who had taken residence on this world, sacrificed himself to banish them forever, and then left his mortal shell and ascended to godhood.</p>
<p>The Clergy believe in many gods, with no pinnacle godhead, but they preach foremost the teachings of Triegenes, that every man has greatness within him, and he merely needs to be challenged to awaken his potential. And while a thousand years have burdened this original message with a complex celestial bureaucracy, vaguely-interpreted visions of a multiverse of planes, and a strong emphasis on the superior potential of humans above all other races, the simple dogma that anyone can improve their life, and that indeed this is the main purpose of life, holds strong appeal. The Clergy is now the most widespread faith in Lanjyr.</p>
<h3 id="danor">Danor</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/o6togygbn6061jo/flagDanor.PNG?raw=1">!Flag_of_Danor</a><br>
Guided by a congress of businessmen and scholars, Danor is devoted to endless progress. Old beliefs, especially religion, are cast aside in the face of newer and more profitable ideas. After surviving an apocalyptic collapse five hundred years ago, reason and hard work have created armies more powerful than any in the world, where a common man can wield weapons as mighty as the magic of legendary heroes. After centuries of complacency, the other great nations eye Danor with envy, and with fear.</p>
<p>Following the Second Victory, the social order in old Danor was upended. The Great Malice left the capital of the Clergy bereft of magic. Horrible monsters that spawned in the border regions of wild magic wrought havoc as quavering holy warriors struggled to destroy them without their divine aid. The whole country was cut off from its usual channels of communication, and in a matter of weeks, thousands of priests killed themselves, believing their gods had died, and many more fled in every direction. A once-mighty nation fractured into desperate enclaves, and the old capitol was abandoned as an accursed place.</p>
<p>A major contributor to the region’s downfall was that its previous leaders—the hierarchs of the Clergy — had been transformed by the Great Malice into seemingly demonic creatures with horns and barbed tails. People in what today are the Malice Lands refused to let these people reach the new capital in Crisillyir, believing the old rulers were “from the deep pit of hell,” and thus dubbed them “deeplings” or “tieflings.”</p>
<p>After decades of chaos, a tiefling named Jierre who had once been a priest near the top of the sacred hierarchy gathered the fractious leaders and managed to convince them in the span of a mere five years to reunite under a new vision. If the hands of the gods could no longer reach into Danor, then it would be the hands of mortals that would give them power and safety.</p>
<p>It was magic, after all, and the superstitions and archaic beliefs that were its trappings, that had held back the people of Danor from their potential. Jierre understood that they had a unique opportunity. No foreign nations would bother a land without magic, so the new Danor needed not to worry about invasion. It would decide its own fate, and as long as all were devoted to the ideal of progress, Danor would one day be the strongest nation in the world. Finally, after centuries of insular work and struggle to build a new society, Danor has begun to claim its place in the world.</p>
<h3 id="drakr">Drakr</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gxdqmcpbvn62s97/flagDrakr.PNG?raw=1">!Flag of Drakr</a></p>
<p>Before the rise of the kingdom of Triegenes, dwarven warlords in Drakr subdued the undead titans of the land, encased them in crystal, and buried them deep beneath the earth. The dwarven warlords allied with the Demonocracy in the east, trading the lives and souls of their mostly-human subjects for infernal power. Each warlord erected a tower as a symbol of his power, and from these bases they marched unnatural armies to battle for territory and supremacy.</p>
<p>Later Triegenes assailed those towers, toppling each as a stepping stone toward the Demonocracy itself. The tyrants fell, and dwarves became an oppressed minority in what had once been their homeland. When the Great Malice shattered the kingdom of Triegenes, several clans of dwarves overthrew the priests who had ruled over them. They prepared for war, intending to recreate new dwarven kingdoms, but the deadly threat from the Malice Lands forced them to band together, even unite with humans to keep newly-birthed abominations at bay.</p>
<p>The dwarven clans and fractured human provinces that survived the collapse of the kingdom of Triegenes created a loose federation that has grown ever more united. Regional governors, mostly human, handle normal farming and trade, while dwarven lords direct grand mining operations and command the nation’s army and navy.</p>
<p>Once again the nation has grown fond of towers, not just as symbols of power but as strongholds against intermittent waves of monstrous incursions from the Malice Lands. Dark magic is not precisely endorsed, but it is tolerated as a necessary evil for the nation’s defense. Criminals convicted of any great crime vanish into mountain prisons to serve in hellish mines, until the day they are sacrificed to empower a magical ward or weapon.</p>
<h3 id="elfaivar">Elfaivar</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wuj35i48yq4b1i7/flagElfaivar.jpg?raw=1">!Flag of Elfaivar</a><br>
Before the Great Malice, the kings of Elfaivar held power to rival all the other nations of Lanjyr. Commanding legions of slave armies from the far east and fielding battalions of fey mages and monsters, the long-lived eladrin monarchs were able to ensure the security and prosperity of the mightiest nation in the world.</p>
<p>Today, only ruins survive.</p>
<p>The Great Malice slew every eladrin woman in the empire and beyond, with only the rarest and most unlikely survivors: women currently polymorphed, on other planes, or who had forsaken the Elfaivaran faith entirely. Within weeks the once-glorious empire, which had been poised to crush the impudent Clergy who had twice launched a holy war against it, descended into chaos. Within decades the population had collapsed to the tiniest sliver of its original number.</p>
<p>A stirring eulogy of the poet Vekesh convinced a few eladrin to seek harmony, to endure, and to prosper — and above all else, to find and free eladrin women from bondage so the race could heal. But for millions of grief-stricken eladrin men, the aftermath of the Great Malice was a time of constant battle.</p>
<p>Those few women who had survived were quickly claimed as property, and anyone who could keep ownership of a wife against a hundred thousand other suitors could command enclaves of desperate followers. Whole cities of despairing men would fight to the death for the chance of winning their lord another wife. Mages laid curses upon swaths of cropland, but some enclaves chose to starve rather than hand over their “queen.” Slavers brought ships of human and elf women magically transmuted to pass as eladrin and then sold into servitude, only to be slain when the truth was discovered.</p>
<p>Many eladrin men fled to other lands, seeking wives of other races, but they could sire no children. As attrition whittled down survivors, and too few children were born to keep society alive, ever more wealth and magical relics pooled in the hands of fewer and fewer men. When foreigners from Crisillyir or the distant east tried to claim Elfaivaran land they were driven back by fearsome eladrin warriors. Trained by constant battles for survival, and possessed of the finest arms and armor of entire cities, each man was match for a hundred normal soldiers.</p>
<p>Eladrin are long-lived, but old age eventually claims even them. Some made pacts with the powers of the Dreaming or other planes, but after two centuries, Elfaivar was practically a ghost nation. It took nearly a century more for Crisillyir and other nations to defeat the few vengeful hold-outs and begin to colonize the empty landscape.</p>
<h1 id="zeitgeist---campaign-3---new-player-guide-1">Zeitgeist - Campaign 3 - New Player Guide</h1>
<p>Steam and soot darken the skies above the city of Flint, and winds sweeping across its majestic harbor blow the choking products of industrial forges into the fey-rainforests that dot its knife-toothed mountains. Since the earliest ages when the people of Risur founded this city, they feared the capricious beings that hid in those fog-shrouded peaks, but now, as the march of progress and the demands of national defense turn Flint into a garden for artifice and technology, the old faiths and rituals that kept the lurkers of the woods at bay are being abandoned.</p>
<p>The Unseen Court, the Great Hunt, and the many spirits of the land long ago conquered by Risur’s kings no longer receive tribute, but they cannot enter these new cities of steam and steel to demand their tithe. The impoverished workers who huddle in factory slums fear monsters of a different breed, shadowy children of this new urban labyrinth. Even their modern religions have no defenses against these fiends.</p>
<p>Times are turning. The skyseers — Risur’s folk prophets since their homeland’s birth — witness omens in the starry wheels of heaven, and they warn that a new age is nigh. But what they cannot foresee, hidden beyond the steam and soot of the night sky, is the face of this coming error the spirit of the next age. The <em>Zeitgeist</em>.</p>

<p>A step away from classic fantasy… Your characters serve in the Royal Homeland Constabulary of the nation of Risur, protecting the country and its citizens from foreign threats lurking within its borders. During missions of investigation, espionage, and assassination, your duty will be to root out hostile spies and pursue international conspiracies.</p>

<h3 id="humans-and-the-great-nations-1">Humans and the Great Nations</h3>
<p>Humans rule three of the five great nations of the continent Lanjyr. Their ascendancy in the past two thousand years toppled a mighty eladrin empire and has provoked belief in doomsday prophecy and fatalism among many dwarves. The campaign begins in Risur, and every PC should have a strong loyalty to the nation, even if the character does not hail from there. While Risur is predominately human, halflings are not unknown, and the nation’s traditional druidic religion makes it a welcome home of elves and gnomes.</p>
<h3 id="eladrin-devas-and-the-great-malice.-1">Eladrin, Devas, and the Great Malice.</h3>
<p>Long ago a civilization of elves known as the eladrin built an empire of magical wonders. Then five hundred years ago the death of the eladrin goddess Srasama caused nearly every eladrin woman to perish. Those few who survived were often claimed as trophies by human conquerors, though a handful of free matriarchs head their own family lines in the ruins of the old empire.</p>
<p>Mortals present at the death of the eladrin goddess have continually reincarnated in the following centuries as devas, as if a sliver of Srasama’s divine spark has granted them a semblance of immortality. Those interested in devas should read the section on Crisillyir.</p>
<h3 id="tieflings-and-dead-magic-1">Tieflings and Dead Magic</h3>
<p>When the eladrin goddess died, Danor became a dead magic zone, and some in that land were marked by a curse, turning them into tieflings. In the centuries since, however, the tieflings have come to rule that nation, and in the last few decades they have begun a revolution of industry and mighty science almost as powerful as the magic they lack.</p>
<h3 id="dwarves-doomsday-and-nihilism-1">Dwarves, Doomsday, and Nihilism</h3>
<p>The major dwarven nation is bleakly resigned to an imminent doomsday, when ancient horrors will claw free from glaciers and engulf the world in a frigid death. Adherence to duty is so ingrained in their culture, however, that the dwarves continue to toil in their forges even as they prepare for the world’s end.</p>
<h3 id="savages-primitives-and-peace-1">Savages, Primitives, and Peace</h3>
<p>Freed from the yoke of toppled dragon tyrants, the youngest of the great nations formed from an alliance of several monstrous races which now live in an uneasy peace as their rulers seek to force the disparate peoples into the modern age.</p>
<h3 id="technology-1">Technology</h3>
<p>While the city of Flint sits under a haze of coal soot, its streets illuminated at night by gaslight lanterns and its ferries powered by steam boilers, the majority of Risur remains at roughly a Renaissance level of technology. Soldiers carry alchemical pistols as back-up weapons, and elite fusilier units carry muskets and carbines, but aside from the occasional new rail line splitting the countryside, most citizens of Risur never see any of the new technology that is changing the world around them.</p>
<p>To be clear, though, there are no automobiles, electric lights, or flying vehicles. Most firearms still are muzzle-loaders, and rifles and revolvers only exist as custom creations of innovative gunsmiths.</p>
<h3 id="piety-and-the-planes-1">Piety and the Planes</h3>
<p>The heavens possess an undeniable hold on the world’s religions, its people, and its very structure. In Risur, skyseers believe that the movements of the night stars foretell the future and direct the fate of the world. More enlightened scholars study distant planes of elemental and temporal power to understand how the flow of their energies affects the fundamental nature of reality. The eladrin people have begun to withdraw into the Dreaming (a shining reflection of this world, inhabited by fey), and to frighten sinners the bishops of the high church of the Clergy invoke condemned spirits from the Bleak Gate (a dark mirror of the real world, where dead linger before they find their eternal reward).</p>
<p>Other planes exist only as postulations, and there are countless theories on the nature of reality. No one in this world has ever traveled to the Astral Plane or Nine Hells, and even travel between the known worlds of the night sky is brief, with summoned beings never remaining more than a few minutes.</p>
<h2 id="character-creation-1">Character Creation</h2>
<p>I assume as a baseline that your characters in the adventure will work for the Royal Homeland Constabulary, a Risuri organization created by King Aodhan to monitor threats to his nation, both domestic and from foreign lands.</p>
<p>Every constable must have passed a background check and magical inquisition to prove his or her loyalty to Risur. These precautions allow even foreign-born citizens to serve, giving the constabulary a valuable tool in pursuing investigations overseas. Groups of constables are often assigned to pool their talents to accomplish dangerous and complex tasks, such as rescue missions,<br>
surveillance to catch smugglers and traitors, and even espionage or assassination.</p>
<p>Every PC should have a strong devotion to Risur, though PCs can certainly have other affiliations and allegiances that may eventually draw them away. Additionally, over the course of the campaign the PCs will encounter other power groups with their own motivations. One of the themes of the campaign is deciding what one believes in and why, so feel free to nudge your fellow PCs toward one faction or another as the campaign progresses. Remember, though, that games can quickly turn unfun without party unity.</p>
<p>Your character starts the adventure at 3rd level.</p>
<h3 id="salary-1">Salary</h3>
<p>As constables of Risur, your characters have a slightly different relationship with treasure than typical Fifth Edition adventurers.</p>
<p>Firstly, you’re assumed to receive a reasonable salary that covers “comfortable” living expenses, but needs not be tracked in-game.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Constabulary’s resources and connections let you requisition the tools you need for your missions. Particularly respectable constables can even make use of magic items from the royal vaults.</p>
<h4 id="upgrades-loot-and-skimming-off-the-top-1">Upgrades, Loot, and Skimming Off the Top</h4>
<p>When you recover magic items, treasure, or other valuables, RHC protocols allow you to make use of them for a limited period of time, if you need them. However once they are no longer required, you are expected to hand them over to higher authorities, who will make proper use of them. If desired, you can place a requisition to keep these items long-term, assuming you file the proper paperwork and your request is deemed warranted. (See Requisitions in Part Two.)</p>
<p>An alternative, of course, is to hold onto items and not report them to the RHC. This is illegal, and would likely be grounds for dismissal. Such pecuniary misdeeds are expected of common police, but the RHC is held to higher standards. Be careful, because prison is not kind to former law officers who turn to crime.</p>
<p>If you should happen to receive a gift during the course of your duties, you can keep it, though the RHC keeps an eye on constables to ensure they are not being influenced by bribes.</p>
<h3 id="classes-1">Classes</h3>
<p>Every class has a place in the world, though the RHC is unlikely to admit a savage barbarian who hasn’t at least learned Risuri manners. Due to its druidic traditions, clerics from Risur tend to have the Nature domain, paladins favor the Oath of the Ancients, and warlocks favor Archfey patrons. However, as long as a person is loyal to Risur, they can be a constable regardless of nation of origin.</p>
<h3 id="religion-1">Religion</h3>
<p>Gods do not make themselves regularly known in this world, and it is impossible to visit the planes where they reside, so it’s even possible to doubt whether they exist at all. Indeed, some strong-willed people have drawn divine power from the shared will of others who share their same philosophy. A few deities played a prominent role in history — like the dead eladrin goddess Srasama and the fishermanturned- god Triegenes — but otherwise you are free to decide which gods your characters worship, if any.</p>
<h3 id="magic-1">Magic</h3>
<p>Only two types of magic are wholly off-limits: long-duration flight, and long-duration planar travel.</p>
<p>The nature of the elemental planes that feed energy into the world makes it impossible for magic to create permanent flight. Powers that grant flight for never last more than five minutes, though flight with wings is fine, as long as the creature is Medium sized or smaller. There are no flying carpets or airships. Since the reported extinction of dragons, flying creatures do not grow any larger than an eagle or condor. Likewise, despite theories that suggest it should be possible to travel to distant planets via mighty rituals, all attempts to visit any foreign world never last longer than a few rounds before the traveler is shunted back to this plane. It is possible to wander into the Dreaming or the Bleak Gate and return, but even these trips are usually only possible when the moon and stars align properly, and getting back can be even more difficult than going in the first place.</p>
<p>Mechanically, this means that no creature can ever leave its home plane for more than five minutes, barring unique circumstances that are beyond the control of player characters.</p>
<h4 id="gold-and-teleportation-1">Gold and Teleportation</h4>
<p>In addition to its value as a precious metal for jewelry and currency, gold can be fashioned into a barrier against teleportation. While characters can teleport freely while carrying gold, but they cannot teleport through an opening framed in gold. Certain buildings thus often have thin strips of gold inlaid around doors and windows; typically, this gold is concealed by additional masonry or some other artistry. Prison cells meant to hold eladrin and others thought to be capable of teleportation are often surrounded by rings of gold.</p>
<p>Similarly, a creature wearing a gold ring — or bracelet, or even a thin thread of gold wire — cannot teleport or be teleported, so those wary of abduction might wear hidden gold toe rings to stymie wouldbe kidnappers. Simply carrying or wearing gold is not a problem unless it forms a full loop. Even with full circles of gold, the protection can be bypassed by simply removing part of the ring. This, combined with the temptation for thieves, keeps gold warding circles from being in common use.</p>
<h2 id="character-backgrounds-1">Character Backgrounds</h2>
<p>Since this is a story driven campaign, it is often a great benefit that your character has a great and rewarding backstory as well. You do not have to share these answers with your fellow players. However, please do share the answers with the DM so I can more tie your character into the plot and storyline during the campaign.</p>
<p>Write a basic background for the character. If you’re having trouble - make a checklist first. What was their childhood like? Adolescence? How wealthy were their parents (or guardians), and how were they treated? How long ago did they become an adult? What have they done to try and start a career as an adult (if anything)?  Make sure you cover the key points from your background selection from the PHB</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe at least two people that are tied to the character. One of them should be friendly to your character - a friend, a parent, a benefactor, etc. One of them should be hostile to your character - a rival, someone you owe money to…</li>
<li>How does your character interact with the others within a group?</li>
<li>What is your character’s role in a group? Is he the new guy? Have they met yet?</li>
<li>What are your character’s goals, conscious and, perhaps, subconscious?</li>
<li>How easily does your character love? Have they been in love?</li>
<li>Is your character racist at all, either now or in their past?</li>
<li>All people believe something that is not true, both about the world around them and about themselves. What lies/untruths does your character believe about themselves and the world around them?</li>
<li>How is your character about material possessions?</li>
<li>What does your character perceive their major problems to be?</li>
<li>What does your character perceive the solutions to those problems to be?</li>
<li>What are your character’s religious beliefs?</li>
<li>What does your character fear? It doesn’t need to be an object. Find something for your character that is a source of either shame or extremely hurt pride. Something that if it came out, your character just knows they’d be ruined, one way or another.  You owe a more than handsome sum to a bookie. You have a bastard child.</li>
<li>How much of a temper does your character have? What sorts of things set them off?</li>
<li>Where is his/her family? Do they have any siblings? Close friends? Who is important to them?</li>
<li>Describe a mannerism or quirk that your character has. If they’re a gambler, do they always have dice they carry? Do they have some kind of unfortunate verbal tic or speech impediment? Do they dress above or below their station? Is it obvious?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="character-themes-1">Character Themes</h2>
<p>Choose one of the nine themes below to provide a quick hook to link your character to the campaign. Your theme is in addition to your race, class, and background. It grants you a bonus feat.</p>
<h3 id="docker-1">Docker</h3>
<p><em><strong>Bohemian working-class artist or performer</strong></em></p>
<p>Flint’s industrial docks — with their unusual conflux of peasant workers, educated engineers, and constantly-arriving refugees from the wars in the border states between Danor and Drakr — have in the past decade given birth to an unorthodox social movement. Graffiti artists brighten soot-cloaked warehouses with colorful murals and boastful self-portraits. Dancers and musicians bolster moods in breezy bars, while amateur philosophers giddy on fey pepper entertain drunken teamsters with humorous moral puzzles that often mock public figures.</p>
<p>Occasionally these popular artists, called dockers, get it in their heads to start a riot or get a tad too precise with their criticism. The dockers and the city police have each taken their hits in these confrontations, and tensions grow higher with every accidental death, but for now Roland Stanfield, the city governor of Flint, seems to have a soft spot for these tepid anarchists.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-docker-1">Playing a Docker</h4>
<p>The docker spirit is not limited just to those who perform in public, but extends to anyone who suffers through hard work and low wages, yet can still appreciate intelligent art for its sublime beauty. The worse conditions get for the workers in Flint, though, the more they turn to dockers for relief from their fatigue. When things get heated, every good docker needs to be able to handle himself in a scrap.</p>
<p>Sometimes a docker gets in over his head, and with a little help from sympathetic bar owners or police officers he’ll drop out of the scene and find a new safer career. In this way, the docker movement has spread to pockets of the city slums and even out to the surrounding farmlands. One popular song on the docks even tells of a graffiti artist who fled to Crisillyir and is now painting cathedrals with subversive interpretations of the Clergy’s doctrines.</p>
<h4 id="feat-dockers-jank-1">Feat: Docker’s Jank</h4>
<p>In a band, every musician has to know his bandmates’ parts in case they need to switch places or pick up the slack. Choose up to four allies; you may change your chosen allies if you spend a few hours training with them. You and those allies can each use Help as a bonus action, but only to aid you or one of your chosen allies. Once a<br>
character uses this ability, he or she must take a short or long rest before doing so again.</p>
<p>Additionally, once per day as a bonus action you can shout a line from an inspiring song to grant an ally a Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level. Except for the limited use, this functions as the Bardic Inspiration feature.</p>
<h3 id="eschatologist-1">Eschatologist</h3>
<p><em><strong>Philosopher devoted to the proper endingsof things.</strong></em></p>
<p>The Heid Eschatol movement began among the dwarves of Drakr, after the scholar Vlendam Heid published a treatise on the myths of his<br>
nation and how they continued to influence modern perceptions. The book captured the culture’s consciousness, particularly a section that<br>
used the legend of the Lost Riders to explain the Drakran tradition of defining civilizations and eras by how they end. In the three decades<br>
since its publication, Heid’s “On the Proper Endings of Things” has given birth to a whole field of academic study devoted to finding the perfect way to end friendships and romances, business relationships, wars, serialized literature, and even one’s own life.</p>
<p>Heid’s disciples refer to themselves as eschatologists, from the term for the study of the end of the world. Their popularity has only strengthened Drakr’s existing obsession with apocalyptic prophecies and doomsaying, and has raised awareness of their beliefs in other nations. The Clergy, however, denies that the dwarven end times are near, and its agents take a dim view of Heid’s followers</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-eschatologist-1">Playing a Eschatologist</h4>
<p>Dwarves from any nation likely feel some sympathy toward Heid Eschatol, and soldiers who fought in the wars in the border kingdoms<br>
between Drakr and Danor often saw enough horrors that when they came home they were comforted by the thought of an orderly judgment day. A handful of apocalyptic cults have sprung up, and increasingly their members are seen less as fringe nuts and more as just another religious sect. Only a few outside of Drakr actually believe in<br>
a literal imminent end of the world, with most adherents simply appreciating the comfort they can find by confronting death with reason instead of fear.</p>
<p>Regardless of how a character was drawn to Heid’s movement, he is likely to give regular thought to the future, especially to life’s thresholds and endings. Every eschatologist regularly updates his will, and pays heed to his companions’ desires in the event of their untimely yet unavoidable deaths. A few race toward death, but most are pragmatic and take exceptional precautions to forestall any accidental demise that might ruin their plans.</p>
<h4 id="feat-proper-ending-1">Feat: Proper Ending</h4>
<p>With the dire knowledge that the world shall end in ice, you do what you can to prevent such fate from befalling your allies. As a bonus action, you can touch a dying creature or a creature that died in the past round. That creature is restored to life if dead, stabilizes, and is considered to have failed no death saving throws, but remains unconscious and has gained 1 point of exhaustion. The body must be relatively intact. This ability doesn’t function on decapitated or disintegrated creatures, for example.</p>
<p>As an action, you can concentrate on your own mortality in order to manifest a zone of cold in a 10-foot radius around you. Once manifested, the zone is stationary, and it lasts until you dismiss it as a bonus action, or you fall unconscious.</p>
<p>At the start of your turn, creatures in the zone take 1d6 cold damage. This increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level. Creatures in the zone cannot heal or gain temporary hit points. Since you manifested this fragment of the world’s icy end, you are affected by the zone even if you are not inside it, and you cannot reduce the damage this power deals to you by any means. Other creatures’ resistances and immunities can still protect them.</p>
<p>Once you manifest this zone, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
<h3 id="gunsmith-1">Gunsmith</h3>
<p><em><strong>Designer and wielder of custom firearms.</strong></em><br>
Knowledge of fusils — the cylindrical weapons that use explosive alchemical reactions to propel bullets at deadly speeds — has existed for<br>
centuries, but these weapons were considered inferior to existing magical attacks, which were more accurate and had less risk of accidental<br>
death. Only after the Great Malice did the Danoran military begin to refine and improve fusils. The latest innovations in these weapons,<br>
now commonly called “guns,” have led to their spread into Risur and Drakr, where industrial production helps equip armies with firepower on par with a well-trained sorcerer.</p>
<p>Firearms fascinate gunsmiths, who are not content simply to purchase and practice with guns. They tweak and tinker with their own refinements, and whenever two such craftsmen cross paths they bargain and deal for each other’s secrets. Especially now that firearms have moved beyond the null magic lands of Danor, seemingly limitless possibilities have opened up for the development of weapons that mix spellcraft and chemistry.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-gunsmith-1">Playing a Gunsmith</h4>
<p>Not all gunsmiths devote their combat training to wielding firearms; some just like to have the weapons for their aesthetic appeal, or to take advantage of the common man’s fear of their power. More often, though, gunsmiths practice endlessly to improve their aim, and try to learn as many trick shots as possible to prove the superiority of their chosen killing device. Those with magical training often master rituals to enchant their pistols. One gunsmith, Lerema Kurtz, is said to be able to conjure a cannon from her petticoat pocket.</p>
<p>Many romanticize the deadly purity of guns, or decorate their weapons with baroque inlays and carvings. A few gunsmiths, however, take a bleaker view, rejecting any form of poetry. They just know guns are damned good at killing people, and that life’s as good as worthless when a bullet costs less than a mug of beer</p>
<h4 id="feat-the-man-with-two-guns-is-god-1">Feat: The Man with Two Guns is God</h4>
<p>You have discovered the coolest fighting style in the world. You can draw and stow two firearms when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one. You can use two weapon fighting with dual pistols (or target pistols) just as with light melee weapons. Any creature you attack with a firearm cannot make opportunity attacks until the start of your next turn.</p>
<p>You are proficient in gunsmithing tools. Crafting common firearms only requires time and money. Crafting a grenade takes 25 gp of materials. Doing it safely takes 10 days of work, or you can rush it in 1 day, but then must succeed on a DC 10 Intelligence check or else the grenade explodes and injures you.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can craft target pistols, rifled carbines, or rifled muskets by paying half their price for raw materials, then spending a day for every 5 gp of total price to craft the item from scratch. Or you can take a normal firearm, spend 25 gp on a rifling kit, and successfully make a DC 10 Intelligence check to upgrade the weapon in a single day. If you fail this check, the weapon is ruined.</p>
<p>Whenever you take a long rest, choose two firearms in your possession to maintain. Those weapons cannot misfire for 24 hours</p>
<h3 id="martial-scientist-1">Martial Scientist</h3>
<p><em><strong>Educated and Analytical Warrior.</strong></em></p>
<p>In the war academies of Danor, students speak of combat like a science. Their curriculum involves not merely practicing forms and maneuvers, but writing theses about renowned warriors, or crafting and defending theorems regarding the mechanics of swordplay. The normally reserved Danorans honor the graduates of these battle colleges like other nations honor great poets and sculptors. As those warriors have proven the efficacy of their innovative techniques, the sentiment has spread throughout Lanjyr, and other nations have founded similar schools.</p>
<p>Any brute can hurl a spear or hack through a ribcage, but students of the war academies bring reason to the savagery of war. Often rising to high military ranks, these scholars of battle study anatomy and perform autopsies to learn vulnerabilities of the body, learn physical theorems that underlie the most effective angles of attack and defense, and take time to ponder the psychological and sociological considerations of mortal conflict — from the vast scope and human cost of an invasion, down to the emotional resonance and cultural significance of specific sword techniques through history.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-martial-scientist-1">Playing a Martial Scientist</h4>
<p>Danor has the greatest concentration of war colleges, but the Banhaman Academy in Risur’s capital Slate has a reputation for elite siege engineers and artillerists, and the Battalion outside of Flint trains the best wilderness forces in Lanjyr. Smaller local schools mostly serve to provide pensions for retired soldiers turned tutors, but even they have led to noteworthy theses, such as The Wounding Effectiveness of Stealthy Singular Rapier contrasted with a Twin Strike of Dual Long Swords, which provoked a very spirited debate and even a few expulsions when things got heated.</p>
<p>In Drakr, emphasis is given to testing the physiological limits of endurance and surviving in battle with limited resources, as would be likely in a world-ending conflict. The Clergy in Crisillyir add a strong theological and monstrous anatomy component to the students in their military academies. The lone war college in Ber has a vast library of battle songs, which according to a disputed theory will inspire the courage and attack accuracy of soldiers, though most likely it is just<br>
meant to keep in check the often wild emotions of its bestial students. You should work with your GM to determine what your graduate thesis was, unless you left before finishing your education.</p>
<h4 id="feat-martial-studies-1">Feat: Martial Studies</h4>
<p>Research is important for science and for combat. If you don’t know just the right fighting technique, you’re pretty sure someone else has published a thesis about it. You gain proficiency in one martial melee and one martial ranged weapon.</p>
<p>In addition, every martial scientist learns the Experimental Strike technique. During the campaign you will have the opportunity to learn new techniques. Keep track of which you know. At the end of a long rest, choose one technique you know. You have access to that technique for the day.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental Strike</strong><br>
Scientific breakthroughs are born of both careful study and wild experimentation. Whenever you use the Attack action and miss with every attack, you may make an improvised attack without spending an action, such as slicing a rope to pin an enemy with a chandelier, or smashing a pipe to spray blinding steam on an enemy. Make an Intelligence check and add your proficiency bonus; the GM determines the DC based on how difficult the task is. For example, dropping a chandelier straight down might very easy (DC 5), but slicing it, grabbing it to arrest its fall and make it jostle, then releasing it at the perfect moment so it swings laterally and flies at<br>
an enemy ten feet away might be hard (DC 20).</p>
<p>The GM should refer to the core rules for guidelines on the effects of improvised attacks. Circumstances will dictate how many foes are affected, how much damage is dealt, and whether any conditions can be applied (such as prone or blinded), but generally this should do at least “setback” damage.</p>
<p>After you use experimental strike you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h3 id="skyseer-1">Skyseer</h3>
<p><em><strong>Folk prophet who see the futures in the stars</strong></em></p>
<p>Truly ancient lore suggests that once the mortal races were able to travel to the stars with the aid of lost magic, much like demons and angels can be briefly summoned into this world. But for the full length of remembered history, the heavens have been nearly inscrutable. The druids, used to thinking in long terms of seasons, years, and the lifespan of trees, were the first to notice subtle connections between the movements of stars and the affairs of this world. They too were first to learn how to step through the veils that lead to the Dreaming or the Bleak Gate, and without their aid King Kelland could never have defeated the fey titans.</p>
<p>For over a thousand years, the druids would gaze into the sky night after night, awaiting dreams that would grant revelations of the future. These seers, by guiding journeyers and heroes with their visions, averted many catastrophes. When the Second Victory led to Srasama’s fall, the skyseers read the signs and helped hundreds of eladrin women flee their homeland so they could avoid genocide.</p>
<p>In the past few centuries, however, the many orders and factions of skyseers in Risur have struggled to divine much of import from the stars. Their visions, never precise or clear to begin with, failed to foresee the rise of Danor’s industry, failed to avert scores of natural disasters and man-made tragedies. The people of Risur still go through the motions of skyseer rituals, but the old druids’ influence has faded. Few young people today aspire to join their once-prestigious ranks.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-skyseer-1">Playing a Skyseer</h4>
<p>Those few who study to be skyseers today usually have a close mentor among the druids. Some may have spent countless nights as children staring up at the stars, before one night waking from a vivid, prophetic dream. Apprenticed to an elder skyseer, they learned the names of the stars and planets, their patterns and influence. Though precise visions are rare, it is still indisputable that magic of travel works better under the full moon, and that any ship that sets sail the night when Jiese enters retrograde within the constellation of the Mad Pirate will face great misfortune before it reaches its destination.</p>
<p>Skyseers favor the night, and with a glance at the starry sky can tell time as precisely as any clock. Even in this new age of technology, most Risuri ship’s captains won’t sail beyond sight of shore without a skyseer aboard. Though their influence has faded somewhat, they still have strong connections with many families, villages, and organizations, and they can easily find a welcome home — as long as they do not begin speaking of prophecies.</p>
<h4 id="feat-skyseer-vision-1">Feat: Skyseer Vision</h4>
<p>As a bonus action you may touch an ally and give them insight into future actions. The touched ally chooses one of the following — attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check — and then rolls a d20. The next time the ally would make the same type of roll before the end of the encounter, they may use the previously rolled result or opt to make a new roll. If the ally has advantage or disadvantage, only the first roll is replaced.</p>
<p>After using this ability you must take a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>
<p>As part of a long rest during which the night sky is visible, you may focus your mind on the future and receive a prophetic dream regarding one question. Upon completion of your rest you awaken with insights into the future as though you had cast a divination spell regarding a task you plan to take the following day.</p>
<h3 id="spirit-medium-1">Spirit Medium</h3>
<p><em><strong>One who contacts and controls the spirits of the dead</strong></em><br>
The Danoran industrial revolution has changed the ways of war, giving even the poorest man weapons that can kill the wealthy and wellequipped. Why then should not matters of the soul also move from the purview of the enlightened into the grasp of the common people? So ask spirit mediums, who wish to explain the mysteries of spirits and the afterlife so that men no longer need priests to tell them what awaits beyond death.</p>
<p>Certainly, many mediums are charlatans who prey on the weakness of bereaved aristocrats. But a few have discovered how to contact the dead through a form of psionic meditation called a séance. Some will only use their talents to help those who have a sincere need to know the secrets of the dead, and will only train students who share the same worldview, but most mediums reject such insularity as smacking of organized religion, and will gladly wake the dead for a quick chat at the drop of a few coins.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-spirit-medium-1">Playing a Spirit Medium</h4>
<p>The ability to speak with the recently departed is of great value to the Royal Homeland Constabulary, which recruits enthusiastically people with useful talents. Compared with the normal life of a medium, criminal investigators seldom have to convey messages between the dead and their living friends and relatives, though such conversations can help elicit otherwise unyielding secrets.</p>
<h4 id="feat-unfinished-business-1">Feat: Unfinished Business</h4>
<p>You possess a deep understanding of spirits and the ties that bind them to the mortal world. With the simplest of actions and words, you can stir the recently deceased into action.</p>
<p>With your urging, the spirit of a recently dead person will speak briefly with you. You can cast speak with dead. The body must be within three miles of where it died, and must not have died more than a day ago. You do not require a complete body as the ability speaks with the spirit and needs no corporeal connection. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>At the GM’s discretion, you could also use this power to communicate with uneasy spirits who have not yet moved on, regardless of how long ago they died. Using this power against undead, or in any combat situation for that matter, is possible but very difficult. By expending this power you can force an undead creature you can see to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). If it fails, you may take control of it for one round, as the dominate monster spell. Alternately you can call up the spirit of a creature whose body you can see that died in the past five minutes. It does not receive a save to resist. Its spirit manifests in a space you choose within 25 feet of you, and performs a single action of your choice as if it were still alive, then disappears.</p>
<h3 id="technologist-1">Technologist</h3>
<p><em><strong>Designer of contraptions and devices</strong></em></p>
<p>Some people cannot get enough of new technology. Those with talent tinker or create. Those without collect, study, or simply nag every engineer and inventor they meet. Whether dabblers or professionals, often these technology enthusiasts come up with ideas for devices that straddle the line between clever and impractical.</p>
<p>In Danor, academies train technologists in specialized fields, while in Drakr master dwarven craftsmen guide huge stables of apprentices in the massive engineering projects. Crisillyir punishes such tinkering with holy flagellation, and eladrin are as unsettled by technology as are the denizens of the Dreaming. A few enterprising technologists in Ber curry favor of the royal court, which responds eagerly to such intellectual pursuits.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-technologist-1">Playing a Technologist</h4>
<p>After centuries of reliance upon swords, bows, plate armor, and the occasional arcane evocation, keeping up with the modern pace of developing technology is daunting to many power groups, especially law enforcement and the military. Such groups might enlist technologists as specialists to explain unfamiliar devices, or to craft specialty weapons or tools. While the Danoran industrial revolution has massproduced many common tools and weapons, only a few have the knowledge and talent to create custom items. Technologists tend to gather lots of disposable tools and weapons, so that they always have something handy in an unusual situation. Many make a point to learn a bit of magic or alchemy as well, though every technologist is inspired by a different vision of what technology can provide.</p>
<h4 id="feat-disposable-simulacrum-1">Feat: Disposable Simulacrum</h4>
<p>By spending 10 gp to acquire the necessary parts, you can craft a contraption, which functions somewhat similarly to a familiar called by the find familiar spell. When deactivated it weighs 5 lbs. and can fit in a pouch or pocket, but you can infuse a bit of your life force into the contraption so that it becomes animate. As a bonus action, you can activate your contraption and place it in an unoccupied adjacent space, at which point it becomes a Tiny construct creature, with a form roughly similar to one of the animals available with find familiar. The contraption has that animal’s stats, with the following adjustments. It uses your AC and save bonuses (if higher), and its hit point maximum is 2 times your character level.</p>
<p>Your contraption acts on your initiative; it moves where you direct it. To get it to take any other action, such as Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help, you must spend an action to control it.</p>
<p>Additionally, your contraption can be designed to perform one special task, such as attacking with a natural or light weapon you integrate into its body, casting a single spell you store in it, or using some other ability (like Lay on Hands or Deflect Missiles) you have access to. You still must spend the appropriate type of action to have your contraption perform this task, and spells or abilities used through the contraption count towards your daily limit. Since it is bonded to you, however, the contraption performs this one special task as if you were performing the action in its space. Changing this special task requires an hour of tinkering. Changing the contraption’s shape requires eight hours at a properly furnished workshop.</p>
<p>You can only control one contraption at a time. Your contraption only functions while within 120 feet of you, beyond which it deactivates. While within that range, you can spend an action to see and hear from its space until the start of your next turn, during which time you are blind and deaf with regard to your own senses.</p>
<p>If reduced to 0 hit points, the contraption is automatically deactivated and you must spend an hour making repairs before you can activate it again. Replacing a lost contraption costs 10 gp and takes eight hours at a properly furnished workshop.</p>
<p>At 5th level you can spend 100 gp to craft a contraption in the shape of a Medium or smaller animal the larger the a weapon that can be integrated into its body.</p>
<h3 id="vekeshi-mystic-1">Vekeshi Mystic</h3>
<p><em><strong>Devotee of the philosophy of slow, proper vengeance against those who oppress the weak</strong></em></p>
<p>If fatalism defines the traditional dwarven philosophy, then the cornerstone of eladrin ideology is that living well is the best revenge.</p>
<p>After the goddess Srasama died and nearly all eladrin women perished with her, there was a great drive in Elfaivar to fight until the last man in a short-sighted bid for vengeance. As the rest of the nation whipped itself into a frenzy, however, a composer named Vekesh wrote a song of mourning that contained a simple sentiment: defeat is only tragedy if we choose to let the story end.</p>
<p>While many eladrins could not be stopped from their self-destruction, Vekesh convinced some of his people that a tale that goes from defeat to revenge to death is a shameful tragedy. Revenge serves only to distract from one’s grief, but is ultimately valueless. Instead, he said, a tale of defeat, resilience, and renewal is the best way to thwart their enemies’ goals.</p>
<p>The proper form of retribution, then, is to endure, rebuild from weakness, and prosper into strength.</p>
<p>His guidance ensured that in at least a few isolated enclaves, the eladrin race pulled back from the brink of annihilation. In the following decades a loosely codified collection of vekeshi teachings spread throughout Lanjyr. The mantras of Vekesh have helped many cope with loss and find a new path for themselves.</p>
<p>To the general public, though, ‘vekeshi’ is synonymous with murderer and terrorist. While the majority of vekeshi avoid violence when possible, Vekesh believed that taking up arms is sometimes necessary to protect those at their most vulnerable. The deepest secrets of vekeshi mysticism are taught only to a rare few adherents who demonstrate a skill for battle, and the wisdom to know when to use their power.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-vekeshi-mystic.-1">Playing a Vekeshi Mystic.</h4>
<p>Anyone might casually study Vekesh’s teachings for a bit of personal guidance, but to be initiated into the mystical side of the philosophy requires painful rituals. Aspirants are taken in the night across the threshold of the Dreaming, where they experience the fall of Srasama through psychic illusions, making them keepers of the shared memory of the Great Malice. Thereafter they are held in a cage for days, along with poisoned food that they must resist, so that the starvation teaches them the importance of patience. Finally, they are burnt until their skin blackens, and then are magically healed to seal in the power of the flames.</p>
<p>If a vekeshi passes these trials, he rests and recovers in luxury as his teachers instruct him in the secrets of the philosophy, and drill into him the necessity of discretion. Upon leaving the Dreaming, vekeshi mystics return to their normal lives, but seek positions of power in military, law enforcement, or the underworld, where they use their authority to punish those who continually threaten people who are simply trying to make a better life for themselves.</p>
<p>Vekeshi mystics seldom gather in large groups, but on certain irregular lunar holidays they slip into the Dreaming for secretive festivals. Only on the rarest occasions will a mystic be called to act openly. Donning an iconic mantle of eladrin armor and a mask that conceals his face, the mystic acts as the surrogate hand of the fallen goddess Srasama, with the sole purpose of meting out punishment against one directly responsible for large-scale suffering.</p>
<h4 id="feat-hand-of-retribution-1">Feat: Hand of Retribution</h4>
<p>You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill, or another skill if you already have Intimidation.</p>
<p>In battle, a vestige of the power of Srasama waits to punish those who harm your allies. When an enemy you’re aware of deals damage to one of your allies, as a reaction you can deal 1d4 radiant damage to the enemy who made the attack. That enemy sees a faint burning outline of a six-armed goddess hovering behind you, which then lashes out in retaliation with blades of fire. You cannot use this power twice against the same creature in the same encounter. After you use this power six times, you must take a long rest before you can use it again.</p>
<p>At 5th level, the damage increases to 1d4 radiant and 1d4 fire. At 11th level, the enemy also catches on fire and takes 1d4 fire damage each round until it spends an action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to put the fire out. At 17th level, using this ability does not require spending your reaction</p>
<h3 id="yerasol-veteran-1">Yerasol Veteran</h3>
<p><em><strong>Highly Regarded naval war hero</strong></em><br>
The islands of the Yerasol Archipelago were perhaps the most verdant, beautiful battleground in history. During two centuries of intermittent warfare, untold thousands of soldiers from Risur and Danor died among the windblown rainforests and flowered beaches of those isles, trying to protect their homelands’ exceedingly prosperous plantations. Those who survived — the ones who didn’t succumb to aberrant infections, crippling physical injuries, or unyielding mental trauma — often turned their war-time glory into profit or political clout.</p>
<p>Poets of the two nations have memorialized, and sometimes sensationalized, the greatest acts of heroism from the Four Yerasol Wars, the last of which ended seven years past. It’s an open secret that history is written by the survivors, and many so-called war heroes were merely lucky enough to witness something brave and amazing, and not die in the process so they could take the credit for themselves. A rare few, however, demonstrated genuine heroism and lived to have their tales told by others.</p>
<h4 id="playing-a-yerasol-veteran-1">Playing a Yerasol Veteran</h4>
<p>Everyone knows the names of a few veterans who distinguished themselves in battle — not quite famous, but certainly memorable. Every veteran of the isles has a story that made him a celebrity, though many do not enjoy recounting their tales. The fact that everyone likes a war hero doesn’t lessen the trauma of having seen friends die.</p>
<p>After two centuries of trial and error, though, Risur and Danor have learned to exploit these heroes of the moment, giving them cushy jobs and helping them reacclimatize to civilian life. It doesn’t do to have a “hero” become a vagabond or a drunkard who will embarrass his nation, after all. The aid and adulation from their nation helps a great many Yerasol veterans become pillars of their communities. Such aid quickly dries up, though, should the hero ever decide to publicly criticize or cast aspersions upon his homeland.</p>
<h4 id="feat-display-of-heroism-1">Feat: Display of Heroism</h4>
<p>You unfortunately have great experience rescuing allies on the battlefield. As an action you can assist an ally who is imperiled. You can lift the ally to their feet if they are prone, and if you have any movement left for the turn you can drag the ally with you. Until the start of your next turn, as long as the ally remains beside you, any attacks made against that ally have disadvantage. Your heroic example can rouse your ally’s, even from the brink of consciousness, allowing the ally to spend a hit die to heal. Only 1 point is actual healing; the rest are temporary hit points.</p>
<p>At 5th level you can do this as a bonus action. At 10th level this no longer requires any action, though you can help no more than two allies this way per turn.</p>
<h2 id="equipment-1">Equipment</h2>
<p>The new technological revolution has produced new weapons, and some items are unique to the Zeitgeist adventure path. More importantly to society at large, today is a civilized time, and fashion is important to showing one’s class.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gk8e1wcvlff0gig/equipmentCivilizedGear.PNG?raw=1">!CivilizedGear</a></p>
<p><strong>Fey Pepper</strong> This rare plant only grows near paths to the Dreaming, and since the fall of the Elfaivar Empire five hundred years ago it has been a black market item in most of Lanjyr. When chewed or smoked, the pepper makes the user giddy and upbeat. With a sufficient dosage, the user begins to hallucinate, though many claim these visions are actually glimpses into the Dreaming.<br>
<strong>Gentleman’s Outfit</strong> This fine outfit includes coat, vest, cane, top hat, and more. Gentlemen do not wear goggles.<br>
<strong>Goggles</strong> Designed for working in factories or laboratories with searing chemicals or embers, these goggles are atrocious for peripheral vision. While wearing them, you gain advantage on saving throws to resist effects that would blind you, but have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.<br>
<strong>Lady’s Outfit</strong> This ornate dress has an excess of weight composed of frills, whalebone corseting, multiple layers of fabric, and possibly a small hat with a lace veil. Still no goggles. Definitely no cogs either.<br>
<strong>Leaf of Nicodemus</strong> Monks cultivate this herb, which grows best on the islands of the Yerasol Archipelago. When crumbled, rolled, and smoked as a cigarette, the monk’s leaf soothes nerves and sharpens perception slightly. It can be addictive if used extensively, but has no social stigma, unlike fey pepper.<br>
<strong>Pocket Watch</strong> In addition to telling time, a pocket watch deters the attention of minor fey. Watches will occasionally stop, skip, or run backward in the presence of powerful fey creatures.<br>
<strong>Surgeon’s Kit</strong> Whenever you treat an injured ally during a short or long rest, you may make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. If you succeed, the first hit die that ally spends restores an additional 5 hit points. If you fail by 5 or more, that first hit die is wasted and restores no hit points.</p>
<h3 id="explosive-alchemicals-1">Explosive Alchemicals</h3>
<p>Early firearms used smoky gunpowder as propellant for its ammunition, but recent alchemical advances have produced firedust. This powdered variant of alchemist’s fire produces practically no smoke when used in firearms, has a lower risk of fouling or corroding the weapon’s internals, and is hydrophobic, allowing it to burn even after immersion in water.</p>
<p>Many other firearm accelerants exist, including magmite (a granular black substance rendered in alchemical furnaces) and phlogistite (translucent red vapor slime that floats in globules if exposed to open air), but firedust is by far the most widely used. Steam engines use a variant, firegems, which burn slower but longer</p>
<p>While it is the source of a firearm’s deadly power, firedust is relatively harmless as a weapon in its own right, since it burns too fast to cause serious wounds like traditional alchemist fire. If someone ignites a cask full of firedust, though, the resulting explosion could seriously hurt those nearby. The dwarves of Drakr field grenadiers who use hand-held explosives, but constables and even criminals find little use for such indiscriminate destruction in an urban environment.</p>
<h3 id="firearms-1">Firearms</h3>
<p>Firearms use explosive alchemicals to fire metal ammunition. Risur produces pistols, carbines, shotguns, and muskets from a variety of factories in Flint and elsewhere. Drakr possesses somewhat superior firearm technology, and it is possible to import (or custommake) grenades and rifled versions of normal firearms. Additional innovations such as metal cartridge ammunition are known to exist, but they are the domain of specialized gunsmiths, and as yet cannot be mass-produced.</p>
<p>For the sake of weapon proficiencies, grenades are considered simple weapons. Any character proficient with a hand crossbow is proficient with a pistol. Likewise, a light crossbow is equivalent to a carbine and shotgun, and a heavy crossbow is equivalent to a musket. Effects such as feats that specifically apply to crossbows also apply to firearms. (Note that every class except druids is proficient at least with light crossbows, so everyone but druids are able to use carbines and shotguns.)</p>
<h2 id="the-city-of-flint-1">The City of Flint</h2>
<p>The city of Flint is the heart of Risur’s industrial revolution, and it is the base of operations for your characters. You and your fellow players should have at least passing familiarity with the City.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Population</strong> — 800,000</li>
<li><strong>Head of Government</strong> — Governer Roland Stanfield</li>
<li><strong>Key Districts</strong> — The Aryes, Bosum Strand, Central District, The Cloudwood, The Nettles, North Shore, Parity Lake, Pine Island, Stray River</li>
<li><strong>Prominent Landmarks</strong> — Cauldron Hill, Parity Lake, Stanfield Canal</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qkdm3b0dhlb60v8/flint.PNG?raw=1">!Flint</a></p>
<h3 id="city-districts-1">City Districts</h3>
<p>Each district has its own mayor who handles local affairs, all of whom are elected except the mayor of The Nettles, whose additional role as guardian of the cursed Cauldron Hill requires he be appointed by the governor and approved by the king.</p>
<p>Districts also elect representatives to the city council, whose authority is balanced against that of the city governor, Roland Stanfield. Technically the position of governor is elected, but aside from brief periods after the deaths of various incarnations, Stanfield has held the position for over four centuries.</p>
<h4 id="bosum-strand-1">Bosum Strand</h4>
<p>Depending on who you ask, the name Bosum Strand comes either from the boatswains who frequented its taverns, or from the harbor’s more traditional name, which translated to bosom of the sea.</p>
<p>In either case, the docks along the east shore of Flint Bay are the heart of the city’s trade, culture, and crime. Hundreds of warehouses serve Flint’s merchant fleet, and dozens of bars, taverns, gambling houses, and brothels serve its dock workers. Craftsmen, artists, and money changers own shops surrounding several scattered public squares throughout the district, and the district’s mayor Griffin Stowe has strong-armed property owners along major streets to ensure that when the wealthy and influential travel the strand they are not forced to see any of the district’s uncouth underbelly.</p>
<p>This is why, of course, the dockers make a point to perform on as many street corners and squares as possible.</p>
<p>The district is currently clearing out tenants and demolishing buildings for a freight rail line. The station is already under construction, and once complete it will speed delivery of raw materials and natural exports. More importantly, it will let Flint share its industrial bounty with the rest of the nation. Unusually, many local druids have been recruited to speak with the spirits of the land</p>
<h4 id="central-1">Central</h4>
<p>The oldest and most developed district of Flint is home to its main government structures, including the city council, superior court, police headquarters, and the offices of various civil functionaries like tax collectors. Grand party halls, ornate druidic garden temples, and parks filled with monuments to old wars provide recreation and entertainment for the city’s nobility and prospering middle class, while the Orange Street commodities market and the prestigious Pardwight University are the dual hearts of Flint’s economic and academic cultures.</p>
<p>The district mayor Oncala Putnam recently approved construction of a grand subrail station to serve as the hub of a city-wide transportation network. Currently the Central district is often clogged with traffic from the surface rail station, since the proposed tunnel through Humble Hill in the Nettles, meant to provide an easier route to the factories of Parity Lake, has been dogged by sabotage from elements opposed to the industrialization of Risur.</p>
<p>Just off the coast in Flint Bay, the city governor’s mansion occupies what was once an island fortress. For the past 400 years Roland Stanfield has, through various incarnations and with only rare disruption, served as city governor, earning near universal respect for his wisdom and leadership.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Central district is home to the local headquarters of the Royal Homeland Constabulary, headed by Lady Inspectress Margaret Saxby.</p>
<h4 id="cloudwood-1">Cloudwood</h4>
<p>The eastern outskirts of Flint are dominated by towering mountains, their peaks constantly shrouded in clouds that feed lush rainforests and verdant streams. The steep highlands are sparsely populated, but numerous plantations and small farms fill the flatter terrain near the coast. Few city folk venture out to these lands, believing that here the veil between the real world and the Dreaming is thin. Local myths include countless tales of farmers, travelers, and juvenile miscreants who wander into the foggy woods and suffer wretched fates at the hands of capricious fey.</p>
<p>While most who live in Cloudwood consider it common courtesy to share a bowl of milk or plates of sliced fruit with unseen nightly visitors, the district’s new mayor, Doyle Idylls, has forbidden district employees from engaging in the old tradition. Mayor Idylls shares his office with the local police branch, and he recently had salt baked into bricks around its base in order to keep away curious fey. Soon after, the building developed a gopher problem.</p>
<p>Though criminals in Flint tend to make the Nettles their first stop when on the run from the law, those who really need to lay low find the wild rainforests of Cloudwood ideal. The most rural areas of the district are practically independent thorps and hamlets, many of which are sympathetic to desperate outsiders.</p>
<h4 id="the-nettles-1">The Nettles</h4>
<p>A small spur of the mountains of the Cloudwood cuts into the heart of Flint, and for most of the city’s history these hills were home to druidic rituals, or simply let romantics witness wondrous vistas of the beaches from on high. Their traditional name came from an old commander of the Flint fort, who saw them as a thorny barrier against attack from the north.</p>
<p>But then in 346 a.o.v. a coven of witches took residence upon a jagged mountain at the range’s edge, which ever since has been called Cauldron Hill. For decades they terrorized the city, sending goblins and specters to abduct people for sacrificial rites, then hiding in the veil between this world and the Black Gate whenever any tried to assault them. Eventually the witches were defeated when King Lorcan allied with a Crisillyiri godhand and led an assault during a lunar eclipse. Ever since, the peak of Cauldron Hill has been rife with haunting and spirit activity, and one of the key tasks of the district mayor has been to keep daring fools from ascending the mountain and coming down possessed.</p>
<p>The greatest achievement of the previous district mayor was constructing a highway across Humble Hill to make travel across the city easier, but in the past few decades the district, even the base of Cauldron Hill itself, have grown thick with slum housing, as more and more people flock to Flint hoping to find work in the factories. The broad switchbacks of the highway are cluttered with shacks, often with two or three families sharing the same building. Poorly crafted houses cling to the sides of slopes, and they have become a nightmare for local police to patrol, giving a whole new connotation to the name “The Nettles.”</p>
<p>Current district mayor Reed Macbannin has been unable to halt the new arrivals, and he hasn’t been helped by the common prejudice that the factory workers are prone to crime, laziness, and general mayhem. Despite this, he has managed to earn passing respect from the people of his district; few are trusted with the stewardship of Cauldron Hill, and he has leveraged his office to get city tax money for the poorest of the poor.</p>
<h4 id="north-shore-1">North Shore</h4>
<p>The sun rises through the mists of Cloudwood, banishing the night with pale purple clouds dashed by the golden gleam of dawn. Fresh sea breezes sweep the gloomy haze of soot away from pristine beaches, letting clear daylight fall upon gently crashing waves. The day wanes, and the sky explodes with crimson and vermilion as the sun sets behind the twin peaks of Great Horned Mountain. Night drapes a starry curtain across the world, and still the waves gently lap upon the North Shore.</p>
<p>Home to the most beautiful urban beaches in all of Lanjyr, Flint’s North Shore district prides itself on its appearance, despite being so close to the polluted Parity Lake. Demand for beachside property has pushed out all but the wealthiest land-owners, those who can afford to hire druids to pray for favorable winds to keep the smoke at bay, and armies of cleaning crews to scrub their walls and streets when the druids fail.</p>
<p>Of course with wealth comes corruption and temptation. Young girls end up dead in alleys. Criminals stage daring robberies of villas protected by curses. Destitute nobles, dragged down from their towers by the machinations of rivals, stumble from nighttime streets into strangely-scented shops they’d never seen before and find offers they cannot refuse.</p>
<p>The district mayor, Aaron Choir, unabashedly serves the interests of the wealthy, and he is currently petitioning to build a wall between North Shore and Parity Lake to keep out “undesirables.” Likewise, police violently deter the occasional protest that crops up outside the Danoran consulate, which sits a few blocks inland from the shore. Mayor Choir is careful, of course, not to appear too friendly with the unpopular Danorans, no matter how much they pay him in kick-backs.</p>
<h4 id="parity-lake-1">Parity Lake</h4>
<p>When Flint first began building factories, this inland lake, fed by run-off from the Nettles, was chosen by Governor Stanfield. A massive construction project widened and deepened a natural river that ran from the lake to the Bosum Strand harbor, providing easy transit of manufactured goods out of — and coal or heating oil into — the district. Homes of fishermen on the lake were demolished, while new flophouses and stacked tenements were erected for the waves of people who came from around the country seeking work in the new factories. Wealth poured into the city’s coffers, and into the pockets of those canny enough to lease their land here, rather than sell it.</p>
<p>During the Fourth Yerasol War seven years ago, factories in Parity Lake mass-produced firearms, cannons, and other weapons, and a lumber mill transformed logs from the Cloudwood into components for shipyards in Bosum Strand. New factories sprang up to create armor for men and ships, and soon even steam engines were being churned out to retrofit Risur’s fleet.</p>
<p>The war effort transformed Parity Lake from a booming collective of new businesses to a crowded, foul-smelling, soot-choked warren, over-crowded with the children of now second-generation factory workers, surrounding a pool that every day more resembles sludge than water. The police manage to keep crime down through heavy-handed measures; the district’s mayor Rosa Gohins has publicly stated that the safety and stability of the factories are more important than the moral of the factory workers.</p>
<h4 id="pine-island-1">Pine Island</h4>
<p>Though the ground of most of Flint’s coast is rocky and hilly, the western coast of the bay has a strange sprawling bayou surrounding dozens of short granite hill-islands. Pine Island takes its name from the aquatic pine trees that anchor the bits of dry land throughout the bayou, though the hills are mostly grassy ranchland. Not as well known or developed as the bustling east coast, this district nevertheless plays a significant role in the city’s business.</p>
<p>While Bosum Strand handles industrial and textile trade, Pine Island services hundreds of plantations in its soggy lowlands and small ranches in its western hills. The main docks on Flint Bay are practically a floating city of wooden bridges and stone anchors, which has slowly grown away from the silt of the bayou to better serve deep-water merchant ships. Further inland, complicated streets, connected by ferries and bridges, weave between islands ranging from the size of a single house to a small neighborhood.</p>
<p>Criminals ply the waters of the bayous in shallow boats, often parking ships of smuggled drugs, magic, or women just off shore, then taking circuitous routes through the flooded forests in order to bypass dock authorities. While most dock-side businesses are legitimate, deeper in the bayou you can find gambling houses, brothels, and fey pepper dens.</p>
<p>Farther west, where there are no longer even occasional hills, the Battalion academy trains elite soldiers and martial scientists in the ways of war, with an emphasis on wilderness survival and the best techniques of intimidation against an occupying force. The district’s mayor, Roger Pepper, is a graduate. Many of the Battalion’s teachers served in the Yerasol Wars and various skirmishes.</p>
<h4 id="stray-river-1">Stray River</h4>
<p>The cluster of businesses and homes where Stray River empties into the bay is the closest thing to a typical Risuri city one can find in Flint. The Stray River district has well-tended streets, quaint two-story brick houses, and enjoys easy prosperity as the place most visitors to the city stay. The district is also home of some of the oldest mills in Risur, powered by small canals that loop off the main river to avoid disrupting water traffic.</p>
<p>One strange attraction of the district is the Penny Pyre. Originally it was a small blackened pit, where a mage’s accident caused copper to burn as easily as wood, but last far longer. When the effect persisted, it became a fixture of the district’s festivals. Various copper sculptures are designed by the districts artisans and placed atop the pit to burn over the course of hours or days. On normal occasions, people will occasionally toss a spare copper coin into the pyre for good luck. The royal mint has tried to end the practice, but the district’s mayor, Chrystine Robinson, defends the tradition, saying more coins are simply lost in the dirt than tossed in the pyre.</p>
<h4 id="the-ayres-1">The Ayres</h4>
<p>North of the city lie a clear island chain and several satellite islands. Many of these are merely rocky sandbars with a few trees, but a few larger islands serve as remote villas for the city’s wealthiest. Nobles hold many family estates here, though one island is owned by a man new to his money: Guy Goodson, who swindled his initial wealth from a dozen naïve villages, and invested early in Flint’s industrial boom. Today he owns dozens of factories in Parity Lake, and regularly dines with his noble neighbors, who delight in the small steamboat he uses to visit them.</p>
<p>Since technically The Ayres is considered part of North Shore, it does not have its own district mayor. In practice, law and government officials never bothers the nobles on their islands unless an equally wealthy or powerful individual lodges a complaint.</p>
<h3 id="the-military-1">The Military</h3>
<p>The Battalion school of war in the bayous of Pine Island trains hundreds of future officers every year, and works in connection with various district forts throughout the city, as well as naval bases on an island near the mouth of Flint Harbor. Flint still remembers a few naval skirmishes that threatened shipping eight years ago, and so the military maintains a constant watch for possible threats. Normally, though, they will not respond unless a district mayor or the city governor himself calls on them.</p>
<p>While few individual soldiers have magical training, the military has acquired over the years a wide variety of enchanted weapons and defenses. Perhaps foremost among these, every soldier stationed in The Nettles district fort is given an amulet to ward them against supernatural influence, should they be called upon to face a reawakening of the eldritch horrors that reigned over Cauldron Hill during the time of the witches.</p>
<p>The local commander of Flint land forces is Colonel Greg Masterson, while the naval defenses are overseen by Rear Admiral Morris Dawkins.</p>
<h2 id="royal-homeland-constabulary-1">Royal Homeland Constabulary</h2>
<p>RHC constables are law enforcement officers tasked with protecting Risur from serious threats, usually in the form of foreign plots, magically- equipped criminals, and various supernatural foes everyday police are not capable of handling. The directorate in Flint generally keeps busy thwarting arms smuggling, industrial espionage, and the sorts of magical and monstrous threats once handled by plucky self-motivated “adventurers.”</p>
<h3 id="authority-and-the-law-1">Authority and the Law</h3>
<p>Constables are invested with the authority of the king, and so are granted great leeway in their pursuit of justice and safety. While normal police must acquire warrants before they can search a building, RHC constables are trusted to not abuse their authority, and so can act as swiftly as needed. However, they are required to fill out proper paperwork and give testimony justifying their actions. A constable who uses his power for personal gain — or to harass anyone of political clout without good reason — will find himself penalized, demoted, and possibly even in prison.</p>
<p>Constables are expected to take suspects alive whenever possible. Do note that the Fifth Edition rules allow characters to choose to subdue an enemy rather than kill it when it’s reduced to 0 hit points, so long as they use a melee weapon and are within 5 feet of the target. Execution is a likely punishment if a trial deems a suspect to be an enduring threat, though some criminals with political value might be kept under special house arrest, as long as they do not actively pursue plots against Risur.</p>
<p>Every constable has access to binding ropes as well as handcuffs (albeit not quite as advanced as the modern variety). Most handcuffs include gold wire or thread, which can be tied off after the cuffs are closed to prevent creatures from teleporting while wearing them. In special cases, magical restraints can be requisitioned.</p>
<p>Constables can usually hand over arrested suspects to the police, though the RHC headquarters in Flint does have specially prepared cells to handle more dangerous criminals. These cells are all lined with enchantments similar to those of mage-cuffs, and are surrounded by rings of gold and bricks baked with salt and other warding agents. When needed, even more specialized items can be used, such as chains that can hold incorporeal entities or prevent shapechanging, hoods that block gaze attacks, and sigils to nullify innate energy threats like flaming elementals.</p>
<p>When it comes to interrogations, this is not a modern police force. Characters who choose to be enlightened and use less-violent approaches can often get what they need with less hassle, but threats and actual violence are common tools when trying to make suspects talk, and most superiors won’t bat an eye as long as no one is seriously injured or dies.</p>
<h3 id="loyalty-to-risur-1">Loyalty to Risur</h3>
<p>The RHC recruits from police, military, universities, and many other sources of talent, occasionally even accepting foreign applicants. In addition to requiring extensive background checks, recruits must undergo a magical inquisition. The king grants each branch’s local director the ability to test the loyalty of all who would apply to join the constabulary.</p>
<p>A candidate who agrees to undertake the test opens their mind so the director may sense their true intentions. If they have any ill will to Risur, its people, or its leaders, it will be revealed. More importantly, the candidate must show a devotion to protecting Risur. Risur need not be the primary concern of the applicant — people are expected, after all, to value their family, friends, even careers — but this precaution has kept the RHC from ever having produced a traitor in the thirty years it has been active.</p>
<h3 id="hierachy-and-teams-1">Hierachy and Teams</h3>
<p>Approximately twenty constables are active in the Royal Homeland Constabulary’s Flint directorate, supported by almost a hundred researchers, office assistants, laboratory technicians, security guards, carriage drivers, and the like.</p>
<h4 id="leadership-1">Leadership</h4>
<p>The Flint branch is run by Lady Inspectress Margaret Saxby, a former superstar investigator who cracked many famous cases, became the darling of the public, and earned herself a knighthood. During the Fourth Yerasol War she married a young nobleman, acquiring clout among aristocratic circles. When the then-director of Flint’s branch of the RHC lost favor in a scandal, she easily won the appointment to take his place.</p>
<p>Lady Saxby leads her branch with incisive intelligence and an experienced intuition for determining which of her constables should pursue which threats. On the other hand, some complain that her confidence borders on megalomania. On several occasions underlings who have become a bit too popular for her liking have received transfers to less prestigious postings.</p>
<p>At nearly fifty, Lady Saxby remains quite fit and retains youthful beauty. She demands authority wherever she goes, and uses many subtle reminders to let people know who is boss. For example, there is only one (expensive, comfortable) chair in her office: hers.</p>
<h4 id="units-and-oversight-1">Units and Oversight</h4>
<p>Saxby’s role as director often has her dealing with bureaucrats and nobles, and while she officially is also the Chief Inspector, she leaves most affairs of investigations to Assistant Chief Inspector Stover Delft, who oversees four units of constables and coordinates their activities.</p>
<p>A local Flinter in his early 40s, Delft gets squinty and condescending when his authority is questioned, but he recognizes talent and good work. Since his own days as a constable, Delft has served a vital role handling logistics; in the past few years he’s even acquired a modicum of leadership skill. He often expresses pride for three of his old underlings who went on to head spy cells overseas.</p>
<h4 id="npcs-you-might-now-1">NPCs you might now</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carlao</strong> a human veteran of the Fourth Yerasol War who proudly wears his plate armor even in the city. He’s something of a director’s pet, and acts as Saxby’s trusted aide.</li>
<li><strong>Serena</strong> a human tinkerer who often crafts gadgets useful for spying and “wet works,” but is surprisingly cheery, seeing all female constables as her sisters.</li>
<li><strong>Kaea</strong> an eladrin evoker widely distrusted by the local fey and druids after she went undercover among the skyseers to expose a vekeshi murderer.</li>
<li><strong>Dima</strong> a dwarf priest with an unhealthy fondness for filing paperwork.</li>
<li><strong>Josiah</strong> a human sniper constantly fiddling with his rifle when he’s not on mission seducing people of interest.</li>
<li><strong>Gaethan</strong> a half-elf ranger whose ability to speak with the dead has made him a bit addled and unreliable, having to carry a notebook to remind himself of his daily affairs</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-setting-1">The Setting</h2>
<p>It was Risur’s traditional enemy Danor—bereft of magic after a cataclysm five centuries past—which began the industrial revolution. Their steam-powered ships and deadly cannon fusillades won them many battles, but the artificers of Flint are combining magic and industry in ways impossible for their enemies, and the tiefling oligarchy of Danor seems content with the land it has acquired. Many of the other great nations, however, fear what Risur can achieve with the marriage of magic and technology, and King Aodhan of Risur worries they might try to disrupt his nation’s safety and prosperity.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the dwarven homeland Drakr preaches of a nihilist doomsday and sells technomantic arms and war machines to warlords and mercenaries across the land. The clergy of theocratic Crisillyir loathe Danor and its tiefling leaders, and they wield piety as a lash to inflame distrust of what they claim is a godless abomination. Just across a mountain border to Risur’s south, the warlike clans of Ber have formed an alliance, which might signal a coming invasion. Even in distant Elfaivar, where the small Risuri colony named Kellandia struggles against settlers from other nations to claim the broken empire’s bounty, the natives lash out at these interlopers, unable to forgive a centuries-old grievance still fresh in their long-lived hearts.</p>
<h3 id="risur-1">Risur</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qtspa3l2mwq25e8/flagRisur.PNG?raw=1">!Flag of Risur</a><br>
Every Risuri child knows that before King Kelland, no human nation had ever endured more than a few years in Lanjyr. The mighty nature spirits known today as the fey titans only allowed the elves to walk their domain, and they terrorized all others with beasts and storms and blight. But in 1200 b.o.v. (Before Our Victory), Kelland subdued the lord spirits of field and forest, of marsh and mountain. With their grudging blessings, he established Risur.</p>
<p>The people of Risur offered the spirits tithing and tribute, and eventually lulled them to sleep. What were once uncharted wilds of fierce beasts and tiny enclaves of elves became a prosperous bastion of humanity. In the seventeen centuries since, Risur’s rites of rulership have ensured that Kelland’s crown only passes to those mighty enough to cow the land’s primal spirits should they ever seek to reclaim their domain.</p>
<h4 id="land-and-culture-1">Land and Culture</h4>
<p>Risur is a subtropical country, possessed of vast forests and fertile fields fed by hundreds of rivers and streams which flow from the southern Anthras Mountains to the northern shore of the Avery Sea. Temperatures are warm but comfortable year-round, though a rainy season strikes near the end of what the northern nations consider summer.</p>
<p>Even the poorest Risuri can enjoy fresh fruit all year round. Wealthy foreigners cherish Risur’s pineapples, limes, bananas, and massive jackfruit, but most prized are its cocoa and sugarcane, and alcohols made of each. A typical Risuri meal consists mostly of fruit, beans, bread, and fish, with the occasional beef or pork. Factory workers in Flint seldom can afford quality meat, and instead make savory stews by soaking bones and sausages in dark beans. Holiday celebrations often include steaming milk flavored with either chocolate or honey.</p>
<h4 id="terrain-1">Terrain</h4>
<p>Four main landscapes make up Risur. The northern Avery Coast is dominated by a mix of wooded beaches — where mountainous granite domes rise out of the sea and anchor dry lands — and forested swamps, often referred to by the native Elven word bayou — where the country’s many rivers sweep soil out into broad floodlands.</p>
<p>The Weftlands of Risur are low plains covering most of the western two-thirds of the country, which draw their name from the countless rivers that weave toward the sea like yarn in a cloth. Most towns and farms lie here, though pockets of wild forests and rocky hills create uninhabitable divides between provinces.</p>
<p>The land rises to the south, and in the mid-altitude hills an unusual swamp wriggles across the landscape, known as the High Bayou. Though the hills are uneven, huge numbers of nesting beasts and giant insects have dammed swaths of the land, slowing the rivers that flow out of the mountains and ensuring a steady source for rivers year-round. Few Risuri live here aside from villages of elves who never integrated with the rest of the nation.</p>
<p>Beyond the High Bayou, the rain-carved Anthras Mountains forms a broad border with Ber. Forests cover most of these mountains, though mining in the east has stripped many peaks. Centuries of attacks from Ber have kept many towns from flourishing here.</p>
<h4 id="flint-city-of-industry.-1">Flint, City of Industry.</h4>
<p>The industrial powerhouse of Flint sits nestled among dozens of granite peaks along the eastern stretch of Avery Coast. With a rapidly-growing population of over half a million, slums for factory workers have begun to clump along these steep hills, while builders work to clear large sections of rainforest from within the city limits. Small satellite towns cling to the islands outside Flint’s harbor, and many foreign nations and businesses have flocked to the city to gain influence in the past forty years.</p>
<h4 id="slate-the-historic-capital-1">Slate, the Historic Capital</h4>
<p>Risur’s capital of Slate lies on the banks of the Great Delve River, in verdant plains fifty miles from the Avery Sea. It is by far the largest city in the country, with a population of nearly a million people. A half-dozen major highways converge on Slate, including the King’s Road. Slate is still the heart of Risur’s internal trade and business, though more and more international trade goes through Flint.</p>
<p>For people used to living in the bustle of Flint, the city of Slate appears stately, calm, and perhaps a bit doddering. The Great Delve River, with its steep banks turning it almost into a man-made channel, generally separates the city into the noble west bank and the common east bank.</p>
<p>Six antique castles sit along the inside of a wide bend on the river’s west bank, arranged in a pattern originally designed to defend against invasion. Each castle acts as a nexus of a community of elite gated villas, and here live the nobles descended from the many kings and queens Risur has had throughout history. Today the district resembles an overly-manicured flower garden, more pretty than practical.</p>
<h4 id="other-cities-1">Other Cities</h4>
<p>Other prominent Risuri cities include the beleaguered Shale on the western coast near the war-wracked Yerasol Archipelago, where druids keep wary watch from sandy barrier islands and shipyards assemble the mightiest sailing vessels in the world; and lumber-rich Bole in the Antwalk Thicket southeast of Slate, source of some of the finest food and theater, and host to finely cultivated forest gardens.</p>
<p>Both cities were once capitals of their own smaller nations in ancient times, before joining with Risur, yet they were always connected by water routes. The Great Delve’s tributaries start near Bole, and the river only widens and deepens as it passes Slate and eventually pours into the sea near Shale.</p>
<p>A dozen other cities with a hundred thousand or more people dot the coastlines, and a few more flourish along the most traversable rivers, but much of the country’s interior is rural.</p>
<h4 id="transportation-1">Transportation</h4>
<p>The numerous rivers across the country hold great potential for trade inland that has not yet been realized. Most trade occurs along the coast, with rivers primarily used to carry lumber downstream to shipyards. Every new king or queen expresses an interest in expanding settlements into the more rural regions, but vast swaths still remain uninhabited.</p>
<p>One development that might change that is the introduction of railroads. Though rail travel is far more prevalent in Danor and Drakr, a few lines have been constructed across Risur, usually traveling perpendicular to the flow of rivers. The most developed line runs from mines in the Anthras Mountains to Flint, helping to feed its hunger for raw industrial materials. Many traditionalists, however, oppose the expansion of the railroad and warn that its churning wheels will anger the native fey.</p>
<h4 id="race-and-religion-1">Race and Religion</h4>
<p>The humans of early Risur outfought or outgrew the native elves, though many elves and half-elves call the land home today. The sub-men races from what is today Ber — gnolls, goblins, kobolds, minotaurs, and orcs — survive in pockets, often as the descendants of slaves taken in old wars, now freed but not accepted.</p>
<p>Some families of halflings mingle with humans in farming communities, and dwarves similarly in mining towns. Tieflings receive an odd mixture of fear and respect, though common folk tend to believe their influence on the nation is dangerous. Other races are too rare for most people to recognize them, and are generally lumped together with eladrin as being distrusted “fey.”</p>
<p>Risur’s main religion is a mix of old human pantheism, elven druidic rites, and reverence for local fey titans who slumber in the earth. Centuries ago many gave worship to the eladrin gods or even archfey who claim to be emissaries of the fey titans, but after the fall of Elfaivar in the Second Victory a cultural shift has taken hold across the whole continent away from fey icons.</p>
<p>For most of Risur’s history, their most respected religious leaders were the skyseers, druids who devoted themselves to understanding patterns in the stars. The skyseers offer guidance and occasionally proclaim prophecies to guide kings, lords, and common folks alike. But the skyseers have many sects, and in the past century their prophecies have grown more and more vague. Many still respect them, but they no longer hold the same political power they once did.</p>
<p>Some elements of the millennium-old Clergy faith have taken root in Risur, in particular the Great Man doctrine, which sits well with a people whose first king personally changed the course of history. However, Risuri reject the Clergy’s elaborate celestial hierarchy of planar domains and stars, which states the dots in the night sky are actual worlds of their own. To the Risuri, such belief reduces the prominence of the mortal races, instead placing greatest import on beings from realms no human has ever visited.</p>
<h4 id="monarchy-and-government-1">Monarchy and Government</h4>
<p>Risur’s current monarch, King Aodhan, rules from Torfield Palace in Slate. Now in his seventies, Aodhan was only thirty when the previous king chose him as his successor. Aodhan had distinguished himself in the Third Yerasol War against Danor, performing feats of strength and heroism most today assume are just tall tales.</p>
<p>Aodhan has always been fascinated by Danor’s technology, ever since he lured its first steampowered warship into a kraken’s reef lair, waited for the crew to abandon ship, then beat back the kraken and single-handedly piloted the vessel—still bearing scars of the kraken’s tendrils—to the harbor of Flint. (Or at least, that’s one story of how it happened.) Once he took the crown, Aodhan pushed for industrial investment to keep up with Danor, but regional governors forced him to keep foreign technologies out of Slate. Flint became the next most obvious choice.</p>
<p>King Aodhan’s aged wife died four years ago. Though heredity and marriage has little impact on national succession, many wonder whether the king will seek a new bride so late in life. Despite his great strength in his youth, the king grows weaker each year.</p>
<p>Many suspect he will name his younger sister Duchess Ethelyn of Shale as his replacement, and indeed she has distinguished herself as a leader in the Fourth Yerasol War that ended seven years ago, even though her city nearly fell to Danor. She is rumored to have close ties to the Unseen Court, and acts as Risur’s ambassador to its nearest neighboring nation. However, her coronation would be the first in Risur’s history that transferred the crown between two blood relatives.</p>
<h4 id="politics-1">Politics</h4>
<p>Twenty-three governors direct the affairs of Risur’s various provinces. Most of these are of noble lineage, descended from one of the nation’s previous kings. Noble governance tends to follow family lines, unlike the crown. Each governor sends several representatives to the national Parliament, which handles the details of implementing the king’s decrees and can with a supermajority overrule them. Various officers of the court and of Parliament direct specific sub-bureaucracies and agencies to handle affairs involving the nation’s commerce, culture, defense, and so on.</p>
<h5 id="history-and-place-in-the-world-1">History and Place in the World</h5>
<p>Risur paved the way to nationhood, and many others followed the same path. By placating the dominant fey titans of Lanjyr they turned the continent into a land for mortals. The Risuri people have always respected the spirits and the fey they share the land with, but they believe the era of those beings has rightfully passed.</p>
<p>While the northern nations waged holy wars between the Clergy and the Seedism faith of Elfaivar,Risur was preoccupied defending its borders from the sub-men of what is modern Ber. The dragons who terrorized the lands south of the Anthras Mountains feared the progress of civilization, and would often gather armies of savages to raid or assault Risur. It is believed that two centuries ago King Boyle slew the last great dragon of Ber, after which attacks from the south finally faded.</p>
<p>No sooner had Risur found safety to its south than did Danor arise in power to the north. Risur and Danor have warred for nearly two hundred years, mostly using the islands of the Yerasol Archipelago as a proxy battle ground, in a series of four Yerasol Wars. Occasional waves of conquest have lapped over each nation’s shores, and today the two countries have more in common than either likes to acknowledge. The current king assumed the throne at the end of the Third Yerasol War, four decades ago, and he presided over the fourth, in which Risur lost much land against the threat of Danor’s superior technology.</p>
<p>Leaders of Risur’s merchant guilds, its military, and its noble families are grateful for the stability, but fear a resumption of hostilities. They have taken advantage of the new international cordiality in order to catch up with Danor’s technological revolution. Whether the next threat comes from Danor or another foe, Risur is arming.</p>
<h3 id="ber-1">Ber</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/f9w11y0n5lq80vp/flagBer.PNG?raw=1">!Flag of Ber</a></p>
<p>Ber’s history is tied to dragons. Until just a few centuries ago, the land was in constant flux, with different dragons battling for supremacy while the mortal races served as their slaves. Tribes of dragonborn, gnolls, goblins, kobolds, minotaurs, and orcs ascended to tiny nation states under the banners of their draconic overlords, built cities and strip-mined mountains to gather wealth for these kings, and eventually collapsed into chaos when their rulers fell. Newborn nations conquered each other like a ring of serpents devouring their tails, and whenever a dragon had willpower enough to unite all of Ber, it would inevitably make the mistake of pressing into Risur or Elfaivar, and be slain in retaliation.</p>
<p>Despite the endless turnover of rulers, Ber did manage to establish a few long-lasting cities— Ursaliña, Reo Pedrecoso, and the capital Seobriga, among others—and develop a shared culture, often thanks to wandering minotaur bards who were seen as neutral. After the death of the last dragon king Inatch the Hex-Eater two hundred years ago, Ber splintered into racial and tribal factions. Only in the past forty years has a semblance of unity returned to the land.</p>
<h3 id="crisillyir-1">Crisillyir</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9x3ygrockibqdme/flagCrisillyir.jpg?raw=1">!Flag of Crisillyir</a></p>
<p>Crisillyir is ruled by the hierarchs of the Clergy, the religion that freed the nation from demonic rule a millennium ago. Today, Crisillyir is a rich land, its fields bountiful, its coffers full of colonial gold. Centuries of divine rituals have turned its great cities into beacons of enlightenment and magical research, though this prosperity seems to attract attention from supernatural threats. Elaborate aqueducts feed water from the snowcapped Enfantes Mountains throughout the nation; it is said that each column in the aqueduct system is engraved with one chapter from the Clergy’s holy book, acting as a massive ward against the ancient evil that still lurks in the land.</p>
<p>In Crisillyir, the power of the church is supreme, but not unquestioned. While the grand summoners conjure forth tortured specters from the Bleak Gate to cow their flocks into piety, collegial arcanists debate conceptions of the cosmos that do not match church dogma. Fat merchant lords pay lip service to the faith, sell weapons and ritual components to eladrin assassins, then purchase indulgences to absolve themselves. And though the inquisitive halo-bearing geneu credetos (‘spirits of belief,’ or more commonly ‘godhands’) are tasked with guarding the nation from unholy, fey, and undead influences, criminal organizations nevertheless manage to smuggle in contraband and use resurrections to extort even the dead.</p>
<h4 id="the-clergy-1">The Clergy</h4>
<p>According to the church’s holy text, one thousand years ago a human fisherman named Triegenes from what today is Danor discovered the secret of divinity while lost in a storm at sea. He returned and preached about the divine spark within all mortals, and how by constantly challenging oneself, a person can become like a god. He inspired followers to fight beside him, and together they toppled tyrants, slew legendary monsters, and eventually established a new nation, based upon a hierarchy of divinity, where rank and reward were based solely on merit.</p>
<p>After his kingdom was established, Triegenes undertook the greatest challenge left in the mortal world: to defeat the Demonocracy that oppressed the lands to the east. He confronted the abyssal lords who had taken residence on this world, sacrificed himself to banish them forever, and then left his mortal shell and ascended to godhood.</p>
<p>The Clergy believe in many gods, with no pinnacle godhead, but they preach foremost the teachings of Triegenes, that every man has greatness within him, and he merely needs to be challenged to awaken his potential. And while a thousand years have burdened this original message with a complex celestial bureaucracy, vaguely-interpreted visions of a multiverse of planes, and a strong emphasis on the superior potential of humans above all other races, the simple dogma that anyone can improve their life, and that indeed this is the main purpose of life, holds strong appeal. The Clergy is now the most widespread faith in Lanjyr.</p>
<h3 id="danor-1">Danor</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/o6togygbn6061jo/flagDanor.PNG?raw=1">!Flag_of_Danor</a><br>
Guided by a congress of businessmen and scholars, Danor is devoted to endless progress. Old beliefs, especially religion, are cast aside in the face of newer and more profitable ideas. After surviving an apocalyptic collapse five hundred years ago, reason and hard work have created armies more powerful than any in the world, where a common man can wield weapons as mighty as the magic of legendary heroes. After centuries of complacency, the other great nations eye Danor with envy, and with fear.</p>
<p>Following the Second Victory, the social order in old Danor was upended. The Great Malice left the capital of the Clergy bereft of magic. Horrible monsters that spawned in the border regions of wild magic wrought havoc as quavering holy warriors struggled to destroy them without their divine aid. The whole country was cut off from its usual channels of communication, and in a matter of weeks, thousands of priests killed themselves, believing their gods had died, and many more fled in every direction. A once-mighty nation fractured into desperate enclaves, and the old capitol was abandoned as an accursed place.</p>
<p>A major contributor to the region’s downfall was that its previous leaders—the hierarchs of the Clergy — had been transformed by the Great Malice into seemingly demonic creatures with horns and barbed tails. People in what today are the Malice Lands refused to let these people reach the new capital in Crisillyir, believing the old rulers were “from the deep pit of hell,” and thus dubbed them “deeplings” or “tieflings.”</p>
<p>After decades of chaos, a tiefling named Jierre who had once been a priest near the top of the sacred hierarchy gathered the fractious leaders and managed to convince them in the span of a mere five years to reunite under a new vision. If the hands of the gods could no longer reach into Danor, then it would be the hands of mortals that would give them power and safety.</p>
<p>It was magic, after all, and the superstitions and archaic beliefs that were its trappings, that had held back the people of Danor from their potential. Jierre understood that they had a unique opportunity. No foreign nations would bother a land without magic, so the new Danor needed not to worry about invasion. It would decide its own fate, and as long as all were devoted to the ideal of progress, Danor would one day be the strongest nation in the world. Finally, after centuries of insular work and struggle to build a new society, Danor has begun to claim its place in the world.</p>
<h3 id="drakr-1">Drakr</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gxdqmcpbvn62s97/flagDrakr.PNG?raw=1">!Flag of Drakr</a></p>
<p>Before the rise of the kingdom of Triegenes, dwarven warlords in Drakr subdued the undead titans of the land, encased them in crystal, and buried them deep beneath the earth. The dwarven warlords allied with the Demonocracy in the east, trading the lives and souls of their mostly-human subjects for infernal power. Each warlord erected a tower as a symbol of his power, and from these bases they marched unnatural armies to battle for territory and supremacy.</p>
<p>Later Triegenes assailed those towers, toppling each as a stepping stone toward the Demonocracy itself. The tyrants fell, and dwarves became an oppressed minority in what had once been their homeland. When the Great Malice shattered the kingdom of Triegenes, several clans of dwarves overthrew the priests who had ruled over them. They prepared for war, intending to recreate new dwarven kingdoms, but the deadly threat from the Malice Lands forced them to band together, even unite with humans to keep newly-birthed abominations at bay.</p>
<p>The dwarven clans and fractured human provinces that survived the collapse of the kingdom of Triegenes created a loose federation that has grown ever more united. Regional governors, mostly human, handle normal farming and trade, while dwarven lords direct grand mining operations and command the nation’s army and navy.</p>
<p>Once again the nation has grown fond of towers, not just as symbols of power but as strongholds against intermittent waves of monstrous incursions from the Malice Lands. Dark magic is not precisely endorsed, but it is tolerated as a necessary evil for the nation’s defense. Criminals convicted of any great crime vanish into mountain prisons to serve in hellish mines, until the day they are sacrificed to empower a magical ward or weapon.</p>
<h3 id="elfaivar-1">Elfaivar</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wuj35i48yq4b1i7/flagElfaivar.jpg?raw=1">!Flag of Elfaivar</a><br>
Before the Great Malice, the kings of Elfaivar held power to rival all the other nations of Lanjyr. Commanding legions of slave armies from the far east and fielding battalions of fey mages and monsters, the long-lived eladrin monarchs were able to ensure the security and prosperity of the mightiest nation in the world.</p>
<p>Today, only ruins survive.</p>
<p>The Great Malice slew every eladrin woman in the empire and beyond, with only the rarest and most unlikely survivors: women currently polymorphed, on other planes, or who had forsaken the Elfaivaran faith entirely. Within weeks the once-glorious empire, which had been poised to crush the impudent Clergy who had twice launched a holy war against it, descended into chaos. Within decades the population had collapsed to the tiniest sliver of its original number.</p>
<p>A stirring eulogy of the poet Vekesh convinced a few eladrin to seek harmony, to endure, and to prosper — and above all else, to find and free eladrin women from bondage so the race could heal. But for millions of grief-stricken eladrin men, the aftermath of the Great Malice was a time of constant battle.</p>
<p>Those few women who had survived were quickly claimed as property, and anyone who could keep ownership of a wife against a hundred thousand other suitors could command enclaves of desperate followers. Whole cities of despairing men would fight to the death for the chance of winning their lord another wife. Mages laid curses upon swaths of cropland, but some enclaves chose to starve rather than hand over their “queen.” Slavers brought ships of human and elf women magically transmuted to pass as eladrin and then sold into servitude, only to be slain when the truth was discovered.</p>
<p>Many eladrin men fled to other lands, seeking wives of other races, but they could sire no children. As attrition whittled down survivors, and too few children were born to keep society alive, ever more wealth and magical relics pooled in the hands of fewer and fewer men. When foreigners from Crisillyir or the distant east tried to claim Elfaivaran land they were driven back by fearsome eladrin warriors. Trained by constant battles for survival, and possessed of the finest arms and armor of entire cities, each man was match for a hundred normal soldiers.</p>
<p>Eladrin are long-lived, but old age eventually claims even them. Some made pacts with the powers of the Dreaming or other planes, but after two centuries, Elfaivar was practically a ghost nation. It took nearly a century more for Crisillyir and other nations to defeat the few vengeful hold-outs and begin to colonize the empty landscape.</p>
